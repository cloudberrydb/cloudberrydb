# Script Name: build-rpm.sh
#
# Description:
# This script automates the process of building an RPM package using a specified
# version and release number. It ensures that the necessary tools are installed
# and that the spec file exists before attempting to build the RPM. The script
# also includes error handling to provide meaningful feedback in case of failure.
#
# Usage:
# ./build-rpm.sh -v <version> [-r <release>] [-d|--with-debug] [-h] [--dry-run]
#
# Options:
#   -v, --version <version>    : Specify the version (required)
#   -r, --release <release>    : Specify the release (optional, default is 1)
#   -d, --with-debug           : Build with debug symbols (optional)
#   -h, --help                 : Display this help and exit
#   -n, --dry-run              : Show what would be done, without making any changes
#
# Example:
#   ./build-rpm.sh -v 1.5.5 -r 2          # Build with version 1.5.5 and release 2
#   ./build-rpm.sh -v 1.5.5               # Build with version 1.5.5 and default release 1
#   ./build-rpm.sh -v 1.5.5 --with-debug  # Build with debug symbols
#
# Prerequisites:
# - The rpm-build package must be installed (provides the rpmbuild command).
# - The spec file must exist at ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/apache-cloudberry-db-incubating.spec.
#
# Error Handling:
# The script includes checks to ensure:
# - The version option (-v or --version) is provided.
# - The necessary commands are available.
# - The spec file exists at the specified location.
# If any of these checks fail, the script exits with an appropriate error message.

# Enable strict mode for better error handling

# This is intentional, but check-rpaths classifies such absolute,
# non-standard rpaths as "invalid" (0x0002) and, on the el10 toolchain,
# turns it into a fatal "%install" error. Setting QA_RPATHS downgrades the
# standard (0x0001), invalid (0x0002) and empty (0x0010) rpath findings to
# warnings so packaging succeeds. This is a no-op relaxation on el8/el9.

# Normalize published artifact file names.
#
# The RPM's Name metadata embeds the major version
# (apache-cloudberry-db-incubating-<major>) so that different major versions
# can be installed side by side. rpmbuild therefore emits files named
# apache-cloudberry-db-incubating-<major>-<version>-<release>....rpm.
#
# For published artifacts we keep the historical file name that omits the
# "-<major>" segment (e.g. apache-cloudberry-db-incubating-2.1.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm),
# matching the distribution naming used by Greenplum. Renaming the file does
# NOT change the package identity: RPM reads Name/Version/Release from the
# package header, not from the file name, so install/upgrade/coexistence and
# `dnf`/`rpm` queries are unaffected.
