 * Both functions name a path on the server's file system and run as the
 * operating system user the server does, so they are as privileged as
 * pg_read_server_files and are granted the same way: to nobody, until someone
 * decides otherwise.
 *
 * The reader is pinned to the coordinator.  Without that the planner may put a
 * function scan on the segments, where each of them would read the whole file
 * and the rows would come back as many times as there are segments.  The writer
 * cannot say the same -- EXECUTE ON is only accepted for a set-returning
 * function -- but it does not need to: it is called in a target list with no
 * FROM clause, which is evaluated on the coordinator, and the query it runs is
 * dispatched from there like any other.
