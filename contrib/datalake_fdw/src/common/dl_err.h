 * dl_err.h
 *	  Error codes shared by the layers below the access method, and the
 *	  channel that carries what the code alone cannot say.
 *
 * A code says which kind of failure occurred.  It cannot say which table the
 * remote catalog rejected, what the storage service answered, or where a remote
 * implementation threw -- and those are the only things that make such a failure
 * diagnosable.  Every layer below the access method therefore reports a code and
 * additionally records the detail here; the entry points that face PostgreSQL
 * turn both into one ereport.
 *
 * The detail is recorded into fixed-size storage on purpose.  Recording happens
 * on paths that must not allocate and must not raise -- a cleanup callback
 * crossing back from C++ is one of them -- so a setter that could palloc, and
 * therefore could fail, is not usable there.  Long values are truncated, which
 * is the right trade against losing the report entirely.
