/*
 * Parquet is the only format so far.  A name that reaches here came from a
 * table option, and is compared the way the other option values of this module
 * are -- without regard to case, so that 'Parquet' is not a second, unknown
 * format.  An unknown one is an ordinary mistake and the caller has to be able
 * to say which name it was -- returning a bare NULL would leave every
 * caller to write that message again, and get it wrong differently.  The name
 * goes into the error detail, so a caller that reports DL_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
 * gets it without knowing this function exists.
