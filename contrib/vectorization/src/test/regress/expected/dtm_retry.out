-- Check if retry logic handles errors correctly.  The retry logic had
-- a bug where error state wasn't cleaned up correctly during retries,
-- leading to PANIC due to ERRORDATA_STACK_SIZE exeeded.
-- Set a fault on one of the QEs such that an error is raised exactly
-- 10 times at the beginning of 2nd phase of 2PC.
-- ERRORDATA_STACK_SIZE is defined as 10.  By erroring out 10 times,
-- the error handling logic in QD gets invoked 10 times.  If error
-- state is not cleaned up before each retry, it is suffice to return
-- an error 10 times to hit the above mentioned PANIC.
