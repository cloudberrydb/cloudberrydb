    <body>
      <p>A deliberate, thorough approach to deploying compatible hardware greatly minimizes risk to
        the expansion process.</p>
      <p>Hardware resources and configurations for new segment hosts should match those of the
        existing hosts. Work with <i>Greenplum Platform Engineering</i> before making a hardware
        purchase to expand Greenplum Database.</p>
      <p>The steps to plan and set up new hardware platforms vary for each deployment. Some
        considerations include how to:</p>
      <ul id="ul_alt_tl5_mr">
        <li id="no160455">Prepare the physical space for the new hardware; consider cooling, power
          supply, and other physical factors.</li>
        <li id="no160456">Determine the physical networking and cabling required to connect the new
          and existing hardware.</li>
        <li id="no160457">Map the existing IP address spaces and developing a networking plan for
          the expanded system. </li>
        <li id="no160458">Capture the system configuration (users, profiles, NICs, and so on) from
          existing hardware to use as a detailed list for ordering new hardware.</li>
        <li id="no160453">Create a custom build plan for deploying hardware with the desired
          configuration in the particular site and environment. </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Planning New Segment Initialization</title>
    <body>
      <p>Expanding Greenplum Database requires a limited period of system downtime. During this
        period, run <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> to initialize new segments into the array and create
        an expansion schema.</p>
      <p>The time required depends on the number of schema objects in the Greenplum system and other
        factors related to hardware performance. In most environments, the initialization of new
        segments requires less than thirty minutes offline.</p>
      <note type="note">After you begin initializing new segments, you can no longer restore the
        system using backup files created for the pre-expansion system. When initialization
        successfully completes, the expansion is committed and cannot be rolled back. </note>

      <title id="no164776">Planning Mirror Segments</title>
      <body>
        <p>If your existing array has mirror segments, the new segments must have mirroring
          configured. If there are no mirrors configured for existing segments, you cannot add
          mirrors to new hosts with the <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> utility. </p>
        <p>For Greenplum Database arrays with mirror segments, ensure you add enough new host
          machines to accommodate new mirror segments. The number of new hosts required depends on
          your mirroring strategy:</p>
        <ul id="ul_dnt_tl5_mr">
          <li id="no165384"><b>Spread Mirroring</b> — Add at least one more host to the array than
            the number of segments per host. The number of separate hosts must be greater than the
            number of segment instances per host to ensure even spreading.</li>
          <li id="no165386"><b>Grouped Mirroring</b> — Add at least two new hosts so the mirrors for
            the first host can reside on the second host, and the mirrors for the second host can
            reside on the first. For more information, see <xref

      <title>Increasing Segments Per Host</title>
      <body>
        <p>By default, new hosts are initialized with as many primary segments as existing hosts
          have. You can increase the segments per host or add new segments to existing hosts.</p>
        <p>For example, if existing hosts currently have two segments per host, you can use
            <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> to initialize two additional segments on existing hosts for a
          total of four segments and four new segments on new hosts. </p>
        <p>The interactive process for creating an expansion input file prompts for this option; you
          can also specify new segment directories manually in the input configuration file. For

      <title id="no165172">About the Expansion Schema</title>
      <body>
        <p>At initialization, <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> creates an expansion schema. If you do not
          specify a database at initialization (<codeph>gpexpand -D</codeph>), the schema is created

        <p>The expansion schema stores metadata for each table in the system so its status can be
          tracked throughout the expansion process. The expansion schema consists of two tables and
          a view for tracking expansion operation progress:</p>
        <ul id="ul_ont_tl5_mr">
          <li id="no165180">

        </ul>
        <p>Control expansion process aspects by modifying <i>gpexpand.status_detail</i>. For
          example, removing a record from this table prevents the system from expanding the table
          across new segments. Control the order in which tables are processed for redistribution by
          updating the <codeph>rank</codeph> value for a record. For more information, see <xref

    <title id="no165351">Planning Table Redistribution</title>
    <body>
      <p>Table redistribution is performed while the system is online. For many Greenplum systems,
        table redistribution completes in a single <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> session scheduled
        during a low-use period. Larger systems may require multiple sessions and setting the order
        of table redistribution to minimize performance impact. Complete the table redistribution in
        one session if possible.</p>
      <note type="important">To perform table redistribution, your segment hosts must have enough
        disk space to temporarily hold a copy of your largest table. All tables are unavailable for
        read and write operations during redistribution. </note>
      <p>The performance impact of table redistribution depends on the size, storage type, and
        partitioning design of a table. For any given table, redistributing it with
        <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> takes as much time as a <codeph>CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</codeph>
        operation would. When redistributing a terabyte-scale fact table, the expansion utility can
        use much of the available system resources, which could affect query performance or other
        database workloads.</p>

      <title id="no167000">Managing Redistribution in Large-Scale Greenplum Systems</title>
      <body>
        <p>You can manage the order in which tables are redistributed by adjusting their ranking.
          See <xref href="expand-redistribute.xml#topic29" type="topic" format="dita"/>.
          Manipulating the redistribution order can help adjust for limited disk space and restore
          optimal query performance for high-priority queries sooner. </p>
        <p>When planning the redistribution phase, consider the impact of the exclusive lock taken
          on each table during redistribution. User activity on a table can delay its
          redistribution, but also tables are unavailable for user activity during redistribution.

          <title>Systems with Abundant Free Disk Space</title>
          <p>In systems with abundant free disk space (required to store a copy of the largest
            table), you can focus on restoring optimum query performance as soon as possible by
            first redistributing important tables that queries use heavily. Assign high ranking to
            these tables, and schedule redistribution operations for times of low system usage. Run
            one redistribution process at a time until large or critical tables have been
            redistributed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Systems with Limited Free Disk Space</title>
          <p>If your existing hosts have limited disk space, you may prefer to first redistribute
            smaller tables (such as dimension tables) to clear space to store a copy of the largest
            table. Available disk space on the original segments increases as each table is
            redistributed across the expanded array. When enough free space exists on all segments
            to store a copy of the largest table, you can redistribute large or critical tables.
            Redistribution of large tables requires exclusive locks; schedule this procedure for
            off-peak hours.</p>

      <title>Redistributing Append-Optimized and Compressed Tables</title>
      <body>
        <p><codeph>gpexpand</codeph> redistributes append-optimized and compressed append-optimized
          tables at different rates than heap tables. The CPU capacity required to compress and
          decompress data tends to increase the impact on system performance. For similar-sized
          tables with similar data, you may find overall performance differences like the
            following:<ul id="ul_ocf_3fr_g4">
            <li id="no163863">Uncompressed append-optimized tables expand 10% faster than heap
              tables.</li>
            <li id="no170207"><codeph>zlib</codeph>-compressed append-optimized tables expand at a
              significantly slower rate than uncompressed append-optimized tables, potentially up to
              80% slower.</li>
            <li id="no170253">Systems with data compression such as ZFS/LZJB take longer to
              redistribute.</li>
          </ul></p>
        <note type="important">If your system nodes use data compression, use identical compression
          on new nodes to avoid disk space shortage. </note>

      <title>Redistributing Tables with Primary Key Constraints</title>
      <body>
        <p>There is a time period during which primary key constraints cannot be enforced between
          the initialization of new segments and successful table redistribution. Duplicate data
          inserted into tables during this period prevents the expansion utility from redistributing
          the affected tables.</p>
        <p>After a table is redistributed, the primary key constraint is properly enforced again. If
          an expansion process violates constraints, the expansion utility logs errors and displays
          warnings when it completes. To fix constraint violations, perform one of the following
            remedies:<ul id="ul_g1d_jfr_g4">
            <li id="no169634">Clean up duplicate data in the primary key columns, and re-run
                <codeph>gpexpand</codeph>. </li>

        <p>You cannot perform redistribution with the expansion utility on tables with dropped
          columns of user-defined data types. To redistribute tables with dropped columns of
          user-defined types, first re-create the table using <codeph>CREATE TABLE AS

      <title>Redistributing Partitioned Tables</title>
      <body>
        <p>Because the expansion utility can process each individual partition on a large table, an
          efficient partition design reduces the performance impact of table redistribution. Only
          the child tables of a partitioned table are set to a random distribution policy. The
          read/write lock for redistribution applies to only one child table at a time. </p>

      <title>Redistributing Indexed Tables</title>
      <body>
        <p>Because the <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> utility must re-index each indexed table after
          redistribution, a high level of indexing has a large performance impact. Systems with
          intensive indexing have significantly slower rates of table redistribution.</p>
