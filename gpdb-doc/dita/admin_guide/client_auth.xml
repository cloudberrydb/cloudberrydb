  <shortdesc>This topic explains how to configure client connections and authentication for
    Greenplum Database.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>When a Greenplum Database system is first initialized, the system contains one predefined
        <i>superuser</i> role. This role will have the same name as the operating system user who
      initialized the Greenplum Database system. This role is referred to as
        <codeph>gpadmin</codeph>. By default, the system is configured to only allow local
      connections to the database from the <codeph>gpadmin</codeph> role. To allow any other roles
      to connect, or to allow connections from remote hosts, you configure Greenplum Database to
      allow such connections. </p>
    <note>The PgBouncer connection pooler is bundled with Greenplum Database. PgBouncer can be
      configured to support LDAP or Active Directory authentication for users connecting to
      Greenplum Database through the connection pooler client connections to Greenplum Database. See
        <xref href="access_db/topics/pgbouncer.xml#topic_fstrm"/>. </note>

    <body>
      <p>Client access and authentication is controlled by the standard PostgreSQL host-based
        authentication file, <filepath>pg_hba.conf</filepath>. In Greenplum Database, the
          <filepath>pg_hba.conf</filepath> file of the master instance controls client access and
        authentication to your Greenplum Database system. Greenplum Database segments have
          <filepath>pg_hba.conf</filepath> files that are configured to allow only client
        connections from the master host and never accept client connections. Do not alter the
          <filepath>pg_hba.conf</filepath> file on your segments.</p>
      <p>See <xref href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html"
          scope="external" format="html"><ph>The pg_hba.conf File</ph></xref> in the PostgreSQL
        documentation for more information. </p>
      <p>The general format of the <filepath>pg_hba.conf</filepath> file is a set of records, one
        per line. Blank lines and any text after the <codeph>#</codeph> comment character are ignored.
        The first matching record is used for authentication. After the first match, the following
        records are not evaluated. If the client cannot be authenticated using the method specified
        in the first matching record, the connection is rejected. A record consists of a number of
        fields that are separated by spaces and/or tabs. Fields can contain white space if the field
        value is quoted. Records cannot be continued across multiple lines.
        Each remote client access record has the following format:</p>
      <codeblock><i>host</i>   <i>database</i>   <i>role</i>   <i>CIDR-address</i>   <i>authentication-method</i></codeblock>
      <p>Each UNIX-domain socket access record has the following format:</p>
      <codeblock><i>local</i>   <i>database</i>   <i>role</i>   <i>authentication-method</i></codeblock>
      <p>The following table describes meaning of each field. </p>

          means the role is granted access without any authentication, therefore bypassing all

    <shortdesc>Greenplum Database allocates some resources on a per-connection basis, so setting the
      maximum number of connections allowed is recommended.</shortdesc>
    <body>
      <p>To limit the number of active concurrent sessions to your Greenplum Database system, you
        can configure the <codeph>max_connections</codeph> server configuration parameter. This is a
          <i>local</i> parameter, meaning that you must set it in the
          <codeph>postgresql.conf</codeph> file of the master, the standby master, and each segment
        instance (primary and mirror). The value of <codeph>max_connections</codeph> on segments
        should be 5-10 times the value on the master.</p>
      <p>When you set <codeph>max_connections</codeph>, you must also set the dependent parameter
          <codeph>max_prepared_transactions</codeph>. This value must be at least as large as the
        value of <codeph>max_connections</codeph> on the master, and segment instances should be set
        to the same value as the master.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>

        <li>
          <p>In <codeph>$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/postgresql.conf</codeph> (including standby

          <p>
            <codeblock>max_connections=100
max_prepared_transactions=100
</codeblock>
          </p>

        <li>

    <title id="ip142639">Encrypting Client/Server Connections</title>
    <shortdesc>Enable SSL for client connections to Greenplum Database to encrypt the data passed
      over the network between the client and the database.</shortdesc>
    <body>
      <p>Greenplum Database has native support for SSL connections between the client and the master
        server. SSL connections prevent third parties from snooping on the packets, and also prevent
        man-in-the-middle attacks. SSL should be used whenever the client connection goes through an
        insecure link, and must be used whenever client certificate authentication is used.</p>
      <p>To enable SSL requires that OpenSSL be installed on both the client and the master server
        systems. Greenplum Database can be started with SSL enabled by setting the server
        configuration parameter <codeph>ssl=on</codeph> in the master
          <codeph>postgresql.conf</codeph>. When starting in SSL mode, the server will look for the
        files <filepath>server.key</filepath> (server private key) and
          <filepath>server.crt</filepath> (server certificate) in the master data directory. These
        files must be set up correctly before an SSL-enabled Greenplum Database system can start. </p>
      <note type="important"> Do not protect the private key with a passphrase. The server does not
        prompt for a passphrase for the private key, and the database startup fails with an error if
        one is required.</note>
      <p>A self-signed certificate can be used for testing, but a certificate signed by a
        certificate authority (CA) should be used in production, so the client can verify the
        identity of the server. Either a global or local CA can be used. If all the clients are
        local to the organization, a local CA is recommended.</p>
    </body>
    <topic id="topic6" xml:lang="en">
      <title>Creating a Self-signed Certificate without a Passphrase for Testing Only</title>
      <body>
        <p>To create a quick self-signed certificate for the server for testing, use the following
          OpenSSL command:</p>
        <p>
          <codeblock># openssl req -new -text -out server.req
</codeblock>
        </p>
        <p>Enter the information requested by the prompts. Be sure to enter the local host name as
            <i>Common Name</i>. The challenge password can be left blank.</p>
        <p>The program will generate a key that is passphrase protected, and does not accept a
          passphrase that is less than four characters long. </p>
        <p>To use this certificate with Greenplum Database, remove the passphrase with the following
          commands:</p>
        <p>
          <codeblock># openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out server.key
# rm privkey.pem</codeblock>
        </p>
        <p>Enter the old passphrase when prompted to unlock the existing key. </p>
        <p>Then, enter the following command to turn the certificate into a self-signed certificate
          and to copy the key and certificate to a location where the server will look for them.</p>
        <codeblock># openssl req -x509 -in server.req -text -key server.key -out server.crt</codeblock>
        <p>Finally, change the permissions on the key with the following command. The server will
          reject the file if the permissions are less restrictive than these.</p>
        <p>
          <codeblock># chmod og-rwx server.key</codeblock>
        </p>
