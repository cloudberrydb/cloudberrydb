    <shortdesc>Memory is a key resource for a Greenplum Database system and, when used efficiently,
      can ensure high performance and throughput. This topic describes how segment host memory is
      allocated between segments and the options available to administrators to configure
      memory.</shortdesc>
    <body id="body_bk2_fvw_wq">
      <p>A Greenplum Database segment host runs multiple PostgreSQL instances, all sharing the
        host's memory. The segments have an identical configuration and they consume similar amounts
        of memory, CPU, and disk IO simultaneously, while working on queries in parallel. </p>
      <p>For best query throughput, the memory configuration should be managed carefully. There are
        memory configuration options at every level in Greenplum Database, from operating system
        parameters, to managing workloads with resource queues and resource groups, to setting the amount of memory
        allocated to an individual query.</p>

        <title>Segment Host Memory</title>
        <p>On a Greenplum Database segment host, the available host memory is shared among all the
          processes executing on the computer, including the operating system, Greenplum Database
          segment instances, and other application processes. Administrators must determine what
          Greenplum Database and non-Greenplum Database processes share the hosts' memory and
          configure the system to use the memory efficiently. It is equally important to monitor
          memory usage regularly to detect any changes in the way host memory is consumed by
          Greenplum Database or other processes.</p>
        <p>The following figure illustrates how memory is consumed on a Greenplum Database segment
            host.<fig id="fig_py5_1sl_zp">

          </fig></p>
        <p>Beginning at the bottom of the illustration, the line labeled <i>A</i> represents the
          total host memory. The line directly above line <i>A</i> shows that the total host memory
          comprises both physical RAM and swap space. </p>
        <p>The line labelled <i>B</i> shows that the total memory available must be shared by
          Greenplum Database and all other processes on the host. Non-Greenplum Database processes
          include the operating system and any other applications, for example system monitoring
          agents. Some applications may use a significant portion of memory and, as a result, you
          may have to adjust the number of segments per Greenplum Database host or the amount of
          memory per segment.</p>
        <p>The segments (<i>C</i>) each get an equal share of the Greenplum Database Memory
            (<i>B</i>). </p>
        <p>Within a segment, the currently active workload management scheme, <i>Resource Queues</i>
           or <i>Resource Groups</i>, govern how memory is allocated to execute a SQL
          statement. These constructs allow you to translate business requirements into execution
          policies in your Greenplum Database system and to guard against queries that could degrade
          performance. For an overview of resource groups and resource queues, refer to <xref href="wlmgmt.xml#topic1" type="topic" format="dita"/>.</p>

        <title>Options for Configuring Segment Host Memory</title>
        <p>Host memory is the total memory shared by all applications on the segment host. You
          can configure the amount of host memory using any of the following methods:<ul
            id="ul_y5m_xzs_zp">
            <li>Add more RAM to the nodes to increase the physical memory.</li>
            <li>Allocate swap space to increase the size of virtual memory.</li>
            <li>Set the kernel parameters <varname>vm.overcommit_memory</varname> and
                <varname>vm.overcommit_ratio</varname> to configure how the operating system handles
              large memory allocation requests.</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>The physical RAM and OS configuration are usually managed by the platform team and system
          administrators. <ph>See the <cite>Greenplum Database Installation
              Guide</cite> for the recommended kernel parameter settings.</ph>
        </p>
        <p>The amount of memory to reserve for the operating system and other processes is workload
          dependent. The minimum recommendation for operating system memory is 32GB, but if there is
          much concurrency in Greenplum Database, increasing to 64GB of reserved memory may be
          required. The largest user of operating system memory is SLAB, which increases as
          Greenplum Database concurrency and the number of sockets used increases.</p>
        <p>The <codeph>vm.overcommit_memory</codeph> kernel parameter should always be set to 2, the
          only safe value for Greenplum Database.</p>
        <p>The <codeph>vm.overcommit_ratio</codeph> kernel parameter sets the percentage of RAM that
          is used for application processes, the remainder reserved for the operating system. The
          default for Red Hat is 50 (50%). Setting this parameter too high may result in
          insufficient memory reserved for the operating system, which can cause segment host
          failure or database failure. Leaving the setting at the default of 50 is generally safe,
          but conservative. Setting the value too low reduces the amount of concurrency and the
          complexity of queries you can run at the same time by reducing the amount of memory available to
          Greenplum Database. When increasing <codeph>vm.overcommit_ratio</codeph>, it is important
          to remember to always reserve some memory for operating system activities.</p>
        <p>To calculate a safe value for <codeph>vm.overcommit_ratio</codeph>, first determine the
          total memory available to Greenplum Database processes, called <codeph>gp_vmem</codeph>,
          with this
          formula:<codeblock>gp_vmem = ((SWAP + RAM) – (7.5GB + 0.05 * RAM)) / 1.7</codeblock></p>
        <p>where <codeph>SWAP</codeph> is the swap space on the host in GB, and <codeph>RAM</codeph>
          is the number of GB of RAM installed on the host. </p>
        <p>Calculate the <codeph>vm.overcommit_ratio</codeph> value with this
          formula:<codeblock>vm.overcommit_ratio = (RAM - 0.026 * gp_vmem) / RAM</codeblock></p>

        <title>Configuring Greenplum Database Memory</title>
        <p>Greenplum Database Memory is the amount of memory available to all Greenplum Database
          segment instances. </p>
        <p>When you set up the Greenplum Database cluster, you determine the number of primary
          segments to run per host and the amount of memory to allocate for each segment. Depending
          on the CPU cores, amount of physical RAM, and workload characteristics, the number of
          segments is usually a value between 4 and 8. With segment mirroring enabled, it is
          important to allocate memory for the maximum number of primary segments executing on a
          host during a failure. For example, if you use the default grouping mirror configuration,
          a segment host failure doubles the number of acting primaries on the host that has the
          failed host's mirrors. Mirror configurations that spread each host's mirrors over multiple
          other hosts can lower the maximum, allowing more memory to be allocated for each segment.
          For example, if you use a block mirroring configuration with 4 hosts per block and 8
          primary segments per host, a single host failure would cause other hosts in the block to
          have a maximum of 11 active primaries, compared to 16 for the default grouping mirror
          configuration.</p>
        <p>The <varname>gp_vmem_protect_limit</varname> server configuration parameter value 
          identifies the amount of memory to allocate to
          each segment. This value is estimated by calculating the memory available for all Greenplum
          Database processes and dividing by the maximum number of primary segments during a
          failure. If <varname>gp_vmem_protect_limit</varname> is set too high, queries can fail.
          Use the following formula to calculate a safe value for
            <varname>gp_vmem_protect_limit</varname>. Provide the <codeph>gp_vmem</codeph> value
          you calculated earlier.<codeblock>gp_vmem_protect_limit = gp_vmem / max_acting_primary_segments</codeblock></p>
        <p>where <codeph>max_acting_primary_segments</codeph> is the maximum number of primary
          segments that could be running on a host when mirror segments are activated due to a host
          or segment failure. </p>
        <note>The workload management scheme currently active (resource queues or resource
          groups) for your Greenplum Database cluster may impose additional considerations
          on <varname>gp_vmem_protect_limit</varname>.</note> 
        <p>Resource queues and resource groups support additional configuration parameters that
           enable you to further control and refine the amount of memory allocated for queries.</p>
