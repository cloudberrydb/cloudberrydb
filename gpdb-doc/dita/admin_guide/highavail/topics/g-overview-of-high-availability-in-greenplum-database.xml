   <title>Overview of Greenplum Database High Availability</title>
   <shortdesc>A Greenplum Database cluster can be made highly available by providing a
      fault-tolerant hardware platform, by enabling Greenplum Database
      high-availability features, and by performing regular monitoring and maintenance procedures to
      ensure the health of all system components. </shortdesc>
   <body>
      <p>Hardware components will eventually fail, whether due to normal wear or an unexpected
         circumstance. Loss of power can lead to temporarily unavailable components. A system can be
         made highly available by providing redundant standbys for components that can fail so that
         services can continue uninterrupted when a failure does occur. In some cases, the cost of
         redundancy is higher than users' tolerance for interruption in service. When this is the
         case, the goal is to ensure that full service is able to be restored, and can be restored
         within an expected timeframe.</p>
      <p>With Greenplum Database, fault tolerance and data availability is achieved

         <title>Hardware Level RAID</title>
         <p>A best practice Greenplum Database deployment uses hardware level RAID to
            provide high performance redundancy for single disk failure without having to go into
            the database level fault tolerance. This provides a lower level of redundancy at the
            disk level.</p>

      <section id="segment_mirroring">
         <title>Segment Mirroring</title>
         <p>Greenplum Database stores data in multiple segments, each of which is a
               Greenplum Database Postgres instance. The data for each table is spread
            between the segments based on the distribution policy that is defined for the table in
            the DDL at the time the table is created. When segment mirroring is enabled, for each
            segment there is a <i>primary</i> and <i>mirror</i> pair. The primary and mirror perform
            the same IO operations and store copies of the same data. </p>
         <p>The mirror instance for each segment is usually initialized with the
               <codeph>gpinitsystem</codeph> utility or the <codeph>gpexpand</codeph> utility. The
            mirror runs on a different host than the primary instance to protect from a single
            machine failure. There are different strategies for assigning mirrors to hosts. When
            choosing the layout of the primaries and mirrors, it is important to consider the
            failure scenarios to ensure that processing skew is minimized in the case of a single
            machine failure.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="master_mirroring">
         <title>Master Mirroring</title>
         <p>There are two masters in a highly available cluster, a <i>primary</i> and a
               <i>standby</i>. As with segments, the master and standby should be deployed on
            different hosts so that the cluster can tolerate a single host failure. Clients connect
            to the primary master and queries can be executed only on the primary master. The
            secondary master is kept up-to-date by replicating the write-ahead log (WAL) from the
            primary to the secondary. </p>
         <p>If the master fails, the administrator runs the <codeph>gpactivatestandby</codeph>
            utility to have the standby master take over as the new primary master. You can
            configure a virtual IP address for the master and standby so that client programs do not
            have to switch to a different network address when the current master changes. If the
            master host fails, the virtual IP address can be swapped to the actual acting master. </p>

      <section id="dual_clusters">
         <title>Dual Clusters</title>
         <p>An additional level of redundancy can be provided by maintaining two Greenplum Database clusters, both storing the same data. </p>
         <p>Two methods for keeping data synchronized on dual clusters are "dual ETL" and
            "backup/restore."</p>
         <p>Dual ETL provides a complete standby cluster with the same data as the primary cluster.
            ETL (extract, transform, and load) refers to the process of cleansing, transforming,
            validating, and loading incoming data into a data warehouse. With dual ETL, this process
            is executed twice in parallel, once on each cluster, and is validated each time. It also
            allows data to be queried on both clusters, doubling the query throughput. Applications
            can take advantage of both clusters and also ensure that the ETL is successful and
            validated on both clusters.</p>
         <p>To maintain a dual cluster with the backup/restore method, create backups of the primary
            cluster and restore them on the secondary cluster. This method takes longer to
            synchronize data on the secondary cluster than the dual ETL strategy, but requires less
            application logic to be developed. Populating a second cluster with backups is ideal in
            use cases where data modifications and ETL are performed daily or less frequently.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="backup_restore">
         <title>Backup and Restore</title>
         <p>Making regular backups of the databases is recommended except in cases where the
            database can be easily regenerated from the source data. Backups should be taken to
            protect from operational, software, and hardware errors. </p>
         <p>Use the <codeph>gpcrondump</codeph> utility to backup Greenplum databases. <codeph>gpcrondomp</codeph> performs the
            backup in parallel across segments, so backup performance scales up as hardware is added
            to the cluster. </p>
         <p>When designing a backup strategy, a primary concern is where to store the backup data.
            The data each segment manages can be backed up on the segment's local storage, but
            should not be stored there permanently—the backup reduces disk space available to the
            segment and, more importantly, a hardware failure could simultaneously destroy the
            segment's live data and the backup. After performing a backup, the backup files should
            be moved from the primary cluster to separate, safe storage. Alternatively, the backup
            can be made directly to separate storage. </p>
         <p>Additional options are available to backup datatabases, including the following:</p>

               <pd>Through native API integration backups can be streamed to a Dell EMC Data Domain
                  appliance.</pd>

               <pd>Through native API integration, backups can be streamed to a Veritas NetBackup
                  cluster.</pd>
            </plentry>
            <plentry>
               <pt>NFS</pt>
               <pd>If an NFS mount is created on each Greenplum Database host in the
                  cluster, backups can be written directly to the NFS mount. A scale out NFS
                  solution is recommended to ensure that backups do not bottleneck on IO throughput
                  of the NFS device. Dell EMC Isilon is an example that can scale out along side the
                     Greenplum cluster.</pd>

         <title>Incremental Backups</title>
         <p>Greenplum Database allows <i>incremental backup</i> at the partition level
            for append-optimized and column-oriented tables. When you perform an incremental backup,
            only the partitions for append-optimized and column-oriented tables that have changed
            since the previous backup are backed up. (Heap tables are <i>always</i> backed up.)
            Restoring an incremental backup requires restoring the previous full backup and
            subsequent incremental backups. </p>
         <p>Incremental backup is beneficial only when the database contains large, partitioned
            tables where all but one or a few partitions remain unchanged between backups. An
            incremental backup saves just the changed partitions and the heap tables. By not backing
            up the unchanged partitions, the backup size and time can be significantly reduced.</p>
         <p>If a large fact table is not partitioned, and a single row is added or changed, the
            entire table is backed up, and there is no savings in backup size or time. Therefore,
            incremental backup is only recommended for databases with large, partitioned tables and
            relatively small dimension tables. </p>
         <p>If you maintain dual clusters and use incremental backup, you can populate the second
            cluster with the incremental backups. Use the <codeph>--noplan</codeph> option to
            achieve this, allowing backups from the primary site to be applied faster.</p>
