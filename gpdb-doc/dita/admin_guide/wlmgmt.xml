  <shortdesc>Greenplum Database workload management helps you prioritize and allocate resources to
    queries according to business requirements and to prevent queries from starting when resources
    are unavailable.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Using workload management, you can limit the number of concurrent queries, the amount of memory used to execute a query, and the relative amount of CPU devoted to processing a query. Greenplum Database provides two schemes to manage workload and resources - Resource Queues and Resource Groups.</p>
      <note type="warning">Resource group-based workload management is an experimental feature and is not intended for use in a production environment. Experimental features are subject to change without notice in future releases.</note>
    <p>Either resource queue-based or resource group-based workload management is active in Greenplum Database; both schemes can not be active at the same time.</p>
    <p>Resource queue-based workload management is enabled by default when you install your Greenplum Database cluster. You can create and assign resource groups while resource queues are active.</p>
    <p>You must explicitly enable resource groups to start using that workload management scheme.</p>

    <p>The following table summarizes some of the differences between Resource Queues and Resource Groups.</p>
