  <shortdesc>Greenplum Database provides features to help you prioritize and allocate resources to
    queries according to business requirements and to prevent queries from starting when resources
    are unavailable.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You can use resource management features to limit the number of concurrent queries, the
      amount of memory used to execute a query, and the relative amount of CPU devoted to processing
      a query. Greenplum Database provides two schemes to manage resources - Resource Queues and
      Resource Groups.</p>
    <note type="warning">Resource groups are an experimental feature and are not intended for use in
      a production environment. Experimental features are subject to change without notice in future
        releases.<p>Significant <ph otherprops="pivotal">Pivotal </ph>Greenplum Database performance
        degradation has been observed when enabling resource group-based workload management on <ph
          otherprops="pivotal">supported versions of </ph>RedHat 6.x, CentOS 6.x, and SuSE 11
        systems. The issue is due to a Linux cgroup kernel bug. The kernel bug has been fixed on
        CentOS 7.x and Red Hat 7.x systems. </p></note>
    <p>Either the resource queue or the resource group management scheme can be active in Greenplum
      Database; both schemes cannot be active at the same time.</p>
    <p>Resource queues are enabled by default when you install your Greenplum Database cluster.
      While you can create and assign resource groups when resource queues are active, you must
      explicitly enable resource groups to start using that management scheme.</p>

    <p>The following table summarizes some of the differences between Resource Queues and Resource
      Groups.</p>
