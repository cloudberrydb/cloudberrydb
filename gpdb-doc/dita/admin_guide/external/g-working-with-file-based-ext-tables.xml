  <title>Working with External Data</title>
  <shortdesc>External tables provide access to data stored in data sources outside of Greenplum
    Database as if the data were stored in regular database tables. Data can be read from or written
    to external tables.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>An external table is a Greenplum database table backed with data that resides outside of the
      database. An external table is either readable or writable. It can be used like a regular
      database table in SQL commands such as <codeph>SELECT</codeph> and <codeph>INSERT</codeph> and
      joined with other tables. External tables are most often used to load and unload database
      data. </p>
    <p>Web-based external tables provide access to data served by an HTTP server or an operating
      system process. See <xref href="g-creating-and-using-web-external-tables.xml#topic31"/> for
      more about web-based tables. </p>
