  <title>Accessing External Data with PXF</title>
  <shortdesc>Data managed by your organization may already reside in external
    sources such as Hadoop, object stores, and other SQL databases. The
    Greenplum Platform Extension Framework (PXF) provides access to this
    external data via built-in connectors that map an external data source to
    a Greenplum Database table definition.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>PXF is installed with Hadoop and Object Storage connectors. These
      connectors enable you to read external data stored in text, Avro, JSON,
      RCFile, Parquet, SequenceFile, and ORC formats. You can use the JDBC
      connector to access an external SQL database.</p>
    <note>In previous versions of Greenplum Database, you may have used the
      <codeph>gphdfs</codeph> external table protocol to access data stored in Hadoop.
      Greenplum Database version 6.0.0 removes the <codeph>gphdfs</codeph> protocol.
      Use PXF and the <codeph>pxf</codeph> external table protocol to access
      Hadoop in Greenplum Database version 6.x.</note>
    <p>The Greenplum Platform Extension Framework includes a C-language extension
      and a Java service. After you configure and initialize PXF, you start a
      single PXF JVM process on each Greenplum Database segment host. This long-
      running process concurrently serves multiple query requests.</p>
    <p>For detailed information about the architecture of and using PXF, refer
      to the <xref href="../../../pxf/5-13/overview_pxf.html" type="topic"
