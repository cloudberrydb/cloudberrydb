    <p><codeph>gpcopy</codeph> is a high-performance utility
      that can copy metadata and data from one Greenplum database to another Greenplum database. You
      can migrate the entire contents of a database, or just selected tables. The clusters can have
      different Greenplum Database versions. For example, you can use <codeph>gpcopy</codeph> to
      migrate data from a Greenplum Database version 4.3.26 (or later) system to a 5.9 (or later) or
      a 6.x Greenplum system, or from a Greenplum Database version 5.9+ system to a Greenplum 6.x
      system.</p>
    <note> The <codeph>gpcopy</codeph> utility is available as a separate download for the
      commercial release of Tanzu Greenplum. See the <xref
