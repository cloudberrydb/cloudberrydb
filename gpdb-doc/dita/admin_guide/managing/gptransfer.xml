  <title>Migrating Data with Gptransfer</title>
  <shortdesc>This topic describes how to use the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility to transfer
    data between databases.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> migration utility transfers Greenplum Database metadata and
      data from one Greenplum database to another Greenplum database, allowing you to migrate the
      entire contents of a database, or just selected tables, to another database. The source and
      destination databases may be in the same or a different cluster. Data is transferred in
      parallel across all the segments, using the <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> data loading utility to
      attain the highest transfer rates. </p>
    <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> handles the setup and execution of the data transfer.
      Participating clusters must already exist, have network access between all hosts in both
      clusters, and have certificate-authenticated ssh access between all hosts in both clusters. </p>
    <p>The interface includes options to transfer one or more full databases, or one or more
      database tables. A full database transfer includes the database schema, table data, indexes,
      views, roles, user-defined functions, and resource queues. Configuration files, including
        <codeph>postgres.conf</codeph> and <codeph>pg_hba.conf</codeph>, must be transferred
      manually by an administrator. Extensions installed in the database with
      <codeph>gppkg</codeph>, such as MADlib and programming language extensions, must be installed
      in the destination database by an administrator. </p>
    <p>See the <cite>Greenplum Database Utility Guide</cite> for complete syntax and usage
      information for the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility. </p>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <ul id="ul_wkb_xqd_cp">
        <li>The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility can only be used with Greenplum Database,
          including the EMC DCA appliance. Pivotal HAWQ is not supported as a source or destination. </li>
        <li>The source and destination Greenplum clusters must both be version 4.2 or higher.</li>
        <li>At least one Greenplum instance must include the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility in
          its distribution. The utility is included with Greenplum Database version 4.2.8.1 and
          higher and 4.3.2.0 and higher. If neither the source or destination includes
            <codeph>gptransfer</codeph>, you must upgrade one of the clusters to use
            <codeph>gptransfer</codeph>. </li>
        <li>The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility can be run from the cluster with the source or
          destination database.</li>
        <li>The number of <i>segments</i> in the destination cluster must be greater than or equal
          to the number of <i>hosts</i> in the source cluster. The number of segments in the
          destination may be smaller than the number of segments in the source, but the data will
          transfer at a slower rate.</li>
        <li>The segment hosts in both clusters must have network connectivity with each other.</li>
        <li>Every host in both clusters must be able to connect to every other host with
          certificate-authenticated SSH. You can use the <codeph>gpssh_exkeys</codeph> utility to
          exchange public keys between the hosts of both clusters.</li>

      <title>What gptransfer Does</title>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> uses writable and readable external tables, the Greenplum
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> parallel data-loading utility, and named pipes to transfer data
        from the source database to the destination database. Segments on the source cluster select
        from the source database table and insert into a writable external table. Segments in the
        destination cluster select from a readable external table and insert into the destination
        database table. The writable and readable external tables are backed by named pipes on the
        source cluster's segment hosts, and each named pipe has a <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process
        serving the pipe's output to the readable external table on the destination segments. </p>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> orchestrates the process by processing the database objects to
        be transferred in batches. For each table to be transferred, it performs the following
          tasks:<ul id="ul_wsd_4tg_dp">
          <li>creates a writable external table in the source database</li>
          <li>creates a readable external table in the destination database</li>
          <li>creates named pipes and <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> processes on segment hosts in the
            source cluster</li>
          <li>executes a <codeph>SELECT INTO</codeph> statement in the source database to insert the
            source data into the writable external table</li>
          <li>executes a <codeph>SELECT INTO</codeph> statement in the destination database to
            insert the data from the readable external table into the destination table</li>
          <li>optionally validates the data by comparing row counts or MD5 hashes of the rows in the
            source and destination</li>
          <li>cleans up the external tables, named pipes, and <codeph>gpfdist</codeph>
            processes</li>
        </ul></p>

      <title>Fast Mode and Slow Mode</title>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> sets up data transfer using the <codeph>gpfdist</codeph>
        parallel file serving utility, which serves the data evenly to the destination segments.
        Running more <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> processes increases the parallelism and the data
        transfer rate. When the destination cluster has the same or a greater number of segments
        than the source cluster, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> sets up one named pipe and one
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process for each source segment. This is the configuration for
        optimal data transfer rates and is called <i>fast mode</i>. The following figure illustrates
        a setup on a segment host when the destination cluster has at least as many segments as the
        source cluster. </p>
      <image id="image_ffp_qgg_cp" href="../../graphics/gptransfer-fast.png"/>
      <p>The configuration of the input end of the named pipes differs when there are fewer segments
        in the destination cluster than in the source cluster. <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> handles
        this alternative setup automatically. The difference in configuration means that
        transferring data into a destination cluster with fewer segments than the source cluster is
        not as fast as transferring into a destination cluster of the same or greater size. It is
        called <i>slow mode</i> because there are fewer <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> processes serving
        the data to the destination cluster, although the transfer is still quite fast with one
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> per segment host.</p>
      <p>When the destination cluster is smaller than the source cluster, there is one named pipe
        per segment host and all segments on the host send their data through it. The segments on
        the source host write their data to a writable web external table connected to a
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process on the input end of the named pipe. This consolidates the
        table data into a single named pipe. A <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process on the output of the
        named pipe serves the consolidated data to the destination cluster. The following figure
        illustrates this configuration.</p>
      <image href="../../graphics/gptransfer-slow.png" id="image_gbx_s3c_dp"/>
      <p>On the destination side, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> defines a readable external table with
        the <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> server on the source host as input and selects from the
        readable external table into the destination table. The data is distributed evenly to all
        the segments in the destination cluster. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Batch Size and Sub-batch Size</title>
      <p>The degree of parallelism of a <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> execution is determined by two
        command-line options: <codeph>--batch-size</codeph> and <codeph>--sub-batch-size</codeph>.
        The <codeph>--batch-size</codeph> option specifies the number of tables to transfer in a
        batch. The default batch size is 2, which means that two table transfers are in process at
        any time. The minimum batch size is 1 and the maximum is 10. The
          <codeph>--sub-batch-size</codeph> parameter specifies the maximum number of parallel
        sub-processes to start to do the work of transferring a table. The default is 25 and the
        maximum is 50. The product of the batch size and sub-batch size is the amount of
        parallelism. If set to the defaults, for example, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> can perform 50
        concurrent tasks. Each thread is a Python process and consumes memory, so setting these
        values too high can cause a Python Out of Memory error. For this reason, the batch sizes
        should be tuned for your environment. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Preparing Hosts for gptransfer</title>
      <p>When you install a Greenplum Database cluster, you set up all the master and segment hosts
        so that the Greenplum Database administrative user (<codeph>gpadmin</codeph>) can connect
        with SSH from every host in the cluster to any other host in the cluster without providing a
        password. The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility requires this capability between every
        host in the source and destination clusters. First, ensure that the clusters have network
        connectivity with each other. Then, prepare a hosts file containing a list of all the hosts
        in both clusters, and use the <codeph>gpssh-exkeys</codeph> utility to exchange keys. See
        the reference for <codeph>gpssh-exkeys</codeph> in the <i>Greenplum Database Utility
          Guide</i>.</p>
      <p>The host map file is a text file that lists the segment hosts in the source cluster. It is
        used to enable communication between the hosts in Greenplum clusters. The file is specified
        on the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> command line with the
            <codeph>--source-map-file=<i>host_map_file</i></codeph> command option. It is a required
        option when using <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> to copy data between two separate Greenplum
        clusters.</p>
      <p>The file contains a list in the following
        format:<codeblock>host1_name,host1_ip_addr
host2_name,host2_ipaddr
...</codeblock>The file
        uses IP addresses instead of host names to avoid any problems with name resolution between
        the clusters. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> transfers data from user databases only; the
          <codeph>postgres</codeph>, <codeph>template0</codeph>, and <codeph>template1</codeph>
        databases cannot be transferred. Administrators must transfer configuration files manually
        and install extensions into the destination database with <codeph>gppkg</codeph>.</p>
      <p>The destination cluster must have at least as many segments as the source cluster has
        segment hosts. Transferring data to a smaller cluster is not as fast as transferring data to
        a larger cluster. </p>
      <p>Transferring small or empty tables can be unexpectedly slow. There is significant fixed
        overhead in setting up external tables and communications processes for parallel data
        loading between segments that occurs whether or not there is actual data to transfer. It can
        be more efficient to transfer the schema and smaller tables to the destination database
        using other methods, then use <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> with the <codeph>-t</codeph>
        option to transfer large tables.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Full Mode and Table Mode</title>
      <p>When run with the <codeph>--full</codeph> option, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> copies all
      user-created databases, tables, views, indexes, roles, user-defined functions, and resource
      queues in the source cluster to the destination cluster. The destination system cannot
      contain any user-defined databases, only the default databases postgres, template0, and
      template1. If <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> finds a database on the destination it fails with
      a message like the
      following:<codeblock>[ERROR]:- gptransfer: error: --full option specified but tables exist on destination system</codeblock></p>
      <p><note>The <codeph>--full</codeph> option cannot be specified with the <codeph>-t</codeph>,
            <codeph>-d</codeph>, <codeph>-f</codeph>, or <codeph>--partition-transfer</codeph>
          options.</note>To copy tables individually, specify the tables using either the
          <codeph>-t</codeph> command-line option (one option per table) or by using the
          <codeph>-f</codeph> command-line option to specify a file containing a list of tables to
        transfer. Tables are specified in the fully-qualified format
            <codeph><i>database</i>.<i>schema</i>.<i>table</i></codeph>. The table definition,
        indexes, and table data are copied. The database must already exist on the destination
        cluster.</p>
      <p>By default, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> fails if you attempt to transfer a table that
        already exists in the destination database:</p>
      <codeblock>[INFO]:-Validating transfer table set...
[CRITICAL]:- gptransfer failed. (Reason='Table <i>database.schema.table</i> exists in database <i>database</i> .') exiting...</codeblock>
      <p>Override this behavior with the <codeph>--skip-existing</codeph>,
          <codeph>--truncate</codeph>, or <codeph>--drop</codeph> options.</p>

      </table>
      <p>The <codeph>--full</codeph> option and the <codeph>--schema-only</codeph> option can be
      used together if you want to copy databases in phases, for example, during scheduled periods
      of downtime or low activity. Run <codeph>gptransfer --full --schema-only ...</codeph> to
      create the databases on the destination cluster, but with no data. Then you can transfer the
      tables in stages during scheduled down times or periods of low activity. Be sure to include
      the <codeph>--truncate</codeph> or <codeph>--drop</codeph> option when you later transfer
      tables to prevent the transfer from failing because the table already exists at the
      destination.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Locking</title>
      <p>The <codeph>-x</codeph> option enables table locking. An exclusive lock is placed on the
        source table until the copy and validation, if requested, are complete. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Validation</title>
      <p>By default, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> does not validate the data transferred. You can
        request validation using the <codeph>--validate=<i>type</i></codeph> option. The validation
          <i>type</i> can be one of the following:<ul id="ul_lqh_wnh_dp">
          <li><codeph>count</codeph> &#8211; Compares the row counts for the tables in the source
            and destination databases. </li>
          <li><codeph>md5</codeph> &#8211; Sorts tables on both source and destination, and then
            performs a row-by-row comparison of the MD5 hashes of the sorted rows.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>If the database is accessible during the transfer, be sure to add the <codeph>-x</codeph>
        option to lock the table. Otherwise, the table could be modified during the transfer,
        causing validation to fail.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Failed Transfers</title>
      <p>A failure on a table does not end the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> job. When a transfer
        fails, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> displays an error message and adds the table name to a
        failed transfers file. At the end of the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> session,
          <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> writes a message telling you there were failures, and
        providing the name of the failed transfer file. For
        example:<codeblock>[WARNING]:-Some tables failed to transfer. A list of these tables
[WARNING]:-has been written to the file failed_transfer_tables_20140808_101813.txt
[WARNING]:-This file can be used with the -f option to continue</codeblock></p>
      <p>The failed transfers file is in the format required by the <codeph>-f</codeph> option, so
        you can use it to start a new <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> session to retry the failed
        transfers.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Best Practices</title>
      <p>Be careful not to exceed host memory by specifying too much parallelism with the
          <codeph>--batch-size</codeph> and <codeph>--sub-batch-size</codeph> command line options.
        Too many sub-processes can exhaust memory, causing a Python Out of Memory error. Start with
        a smaller batch size and sub-batch size, and increase based on your experiences. </p>
      <p>Transfer a database in stages. First, run <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> with the
      <codeph>--schema-only</codeph> and <codeph>-d <varname>database</varname></codeph>
    options, then transfer the tables in phases. After running <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> with
    the <codeph>--schema-only</codeph> option, be sure to add the <codeph>--truncate</codeph> or
      <codeph>--drop</codeph> option to prevent a failure because a table already exists.</p>
      <p>Be careful choosing <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> and external table parameters such as the
        delimiter for external table data and the maximum line length. For example, don't choose a
        delimiter that can appear within table data.</p>
      <p>If you have many empty tables to transfer, consider a DDL script instead of
          <codeph>gptransfer</codeph>. The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> overhead to set up each table
        for transfer is significant and not an efficient way to transfer empty tables. </p>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> creates table indexes before transferring the data. This slows
        the data transfer since indexes are updated at the same time the data is inserted in the
        table. For large tables especially, consider dropping indexes before running
          <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> and recreating the indexes when the transfer is complete. </p>
