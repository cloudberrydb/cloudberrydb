  <title>Using gpbackup Storage Plugins</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can configure the Greenplum Database <xref
        href="../../utility_guide/admin_utilities/gpbackup.xml"><codeph>gpbackup</codeph></xref> and
        <xref href="../../utility_guide/admin_utilities/gprestore.xml"
        ><codeph>gprestore</codeph></xref> utilities to use a storage plugin to process backup files
      during a backup or restore operation. For example, during a backup operation, the plugin sends
      the backup files to a remote location. During a restore operation, the plugin retrieves the
      files from the remote location. </p>
    <p>You can also develop a custom storage plugin with the Greenplum Database Backup/Restore
      Storage Plugin API. See <xref href="backup-plugin-api.xml"/>.</p>
