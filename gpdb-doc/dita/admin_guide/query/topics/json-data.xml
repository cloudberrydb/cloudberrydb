    <title>About JSON Data</title>
    <body>
      <p>Greenplum Database supports two JSON data types: <codeph>json</codeph> and
          <codeph>jsonb</codeph>. They accept almost identical sets of values as input. The major
        difference is one of efficiency. <ul id="ul_qv2_zrw_mq">
          <li>The <codeph>json</codeph> data type stores an exact copy of the input text. This
            requires JSON processing functions to reparse <codeph>json</codeph> data on each
            execution. The <codeph>json</codeph> data type does not alter the input text.<ul
              id="ul_yrn_njf_pfb">
              <li>Semantically-insignificant white space between tokens is retained, as well as the
                order of keys within JSON objects. </li>
              <li>All key/value pairs are kept even if a JSON object contains duplicate keys. For
                duplicate keys, JSON processing functions consider the last value as the operative
                one.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>The <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type stores a decomposed binary format of the input
            text. The conversion overhead makes data input slightly slower than the
              <codeph>json</codeph> data type. However, The JSON processing functions are
            significantly faster because reparsing <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data is not required. The
              <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type alters the input text.<ul id="ul_bzp_hkf_pfb">
              <li>White space is not preserved.</li>
              <li>The order of object keys is not preserved.</li>
              <li>Duplicate object keys are not kept. If the input includes duplicate keys, only the
                last value is kept.</li>
            </ul><p>The <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type supports indexing. See <xref
                href="#topic_aqt_1tw_mq" format="dita"/>.</p></li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>In general, JSON data should be stored as the <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type unless there
        are specialized needs, such as legacy assumptions about ordering of object keys.</p>

        <title>About Unicode Characters in JSON Data</title>
        <p>The <xref href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159" format="html" scope="external">RFC
            7159</xref> document permits JSON strings to contain Unicode escape sequences denoted by
              <codeph>\u<varname>XXXX</varname></codeph>. However, Greenplum Database allows only
          one character set encoding per database. It is not possible for the <codeph>json</codeph>
          data type to conform rigidly to the JSON specification unless the database encoding is
          UTF8. Attempts to include characters that cannot be represented in the database encoding
          will fail. Characters that can be represented in the database encoding, but not in UTF8,
          are allowed.</p>
        <p>
          <ul id="ul_ejw_ppf_pfb">
            <li>The Greenplum Database input function for the <codeph>json</codeph> data type allows
              Unicode escapes regardless of the database encoding and checks Unicode escapes only
              for syntactic correctness (a <codeph>\u</codeph> followed by four hex digits). </li>
            <li>The Greenplum Database input function for the <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type is
              more strict. It does not allow Unicode escapes for non-ASCII characters (those above
                <codeph>U+007F</codeph>) unless the database encoding is UTF8. It also rejects
                <codeph>\u0000</codeph>, which cannot be represented in the Greenplum Database
                <codeph>text</codeph> type, and it requires that any use of Unicode surrogate pairs
              to designate characters outside the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane be correct. Valid
              Unicode escapes, except for <codeph>\u0000</codeph>, are converted to the equivalent
              ASCII or UTF8 character for storage; this includes folding surrogate pairs into a
              single character.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <note>Many of the JSON processing functions described in <xref href="#topic_gn4_x3w_mq"
            format="dita">JSON Functions and Operators</xref> convert Unicode escapes to regular
          characters. The functions throw an error for characters that cannot be represented in the
          database encoding. You should avoid mixing Unicode escapes in JSON with a non-UTF8
          database encoding, if possible.</note>

        <title>Mapping JSON Data Types to Greenplum Data Types</title>
        <p>When converting JSON text input into <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data, the primitive data

        <p>There are some minor constraints on what constitutes valid <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data
          that do not apply to the <codeph>json</codeph> data type, nor to JSON in the abstract,
          corresponding to limits on what can be represented by the underlying data type. Notably,
          when converting data to the <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type, numbers that are outside the
          range of the Greenplum Database <codeph>numeric</codeph> data type are rejected, while the

        <p>Such implementation-defined restrictions are permitted by RFC 7159. However, in practice
          such problems might occur in other implementations, as it is common to represent the JSON
            <codeph>number</codeph> primitive type as IEEE 754 double precision floating point
          (which RFC 7159 explicitly anticipates and allows for). </p>
        <p>When using JSON as an interchange format with other systems, be aware of the possibility
          of losing numeric precision compared to data originally stored by Greenplum Database.</p>
        <p>Also, as noted in the previous table, there are some minor restrictions on the input

    <title>JSON Input and Output Syntax</title>
    <body>
      <p>The input and output syntax for the <codeph>json</codeph> data type is as specified in RFC
        7159.</p>
      <p>The following are all valid <codeph>json</codeph> expressions:</p>
      <codeblock>-- Simple scalar/primitive value
-- Primitive values can be numbers, quoted strings, true, false, or null
SELECT '5'::json;

-- Array of zero or more elements (elements need not be of same type)
SELECT '[1, 2, "foo", null]'::json;

-- Object containing pairs of keys and values
-- Note that object keys must always be quoted strings
SELECT '{"bar": "baz", "balance": 7.77, "active": false}'::json;

-- Arrays and objects can be nested arbitrarily
SELECT '{"foo": [true, "bar"], "tags": {"a": 1, "b": null}}'::json;</codeblock>
      <p>As previously stated, when a JSON value is input and then printed without any additional
        processing, the <codeph>json</codeph> data type outputs the same text that was input, while
        the <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type does not preserve semantically-insignificant details
        such as whitespace. For example, note the differences here:</p>
      <codeblock>SELECT '{"bar": "baz", "balance": 7.77, "active":false}'::json;
                      json                       
-------------------------------------------------
 {"bar": "baz", "balance": 7.77, "active":false}
(1 row)

SELECT '{"bar": "baz", "balance": 7.77, "active":false}'::jsonb;
                      jsonb                       
--------------------------------------------------
 {"bar": "baz", "active": false, "balance": 7.77}
(1 row)</codeblock>
      <p>One semantically-insignificant detail worth noting is that with the <codeph>jsonb</codeph>
        data type, numbers will be printed according to the behavior of the underlying numeric type.
        In practice, this means that numbers entered with E notation will be printed without it, for
        example:</p>
      <codeblock>SELECT '{"reading": 1.230e-5}'::json, '{"reading": 1.230e-5}'::jsonb;
         json          |          jsonb          
-----------------------+-------------------------
 {"reading": 1.230e-5} | {"reading": 0.00001230}
(1 row)</codeblock>
      <p>However, the <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data type preserves trailing fractional zeroes, as seen
        in previous example, even though those are semantically insignificant for purposes such as
        equality checks.</p>

    <title>Designing JSON documents</title>
    <body>
      <p>Representing data as JSON can be considerably more flexible than the traditional relational
        data model, which is compelling in environments where requirements are fluid. It is quite
        possible for both approaches to co-exist and complement each other within the same
        application. However, even for applications where maximal flexibility is desired, it is
        still recommended that JSON documents have a somewhat fixed structure. The structure is
        typically unenforced (though enforcing some business rules declaratively is possible), but
        having a predictable structure makes it easier to write queries that usefully summarize a
        set of JSON documents (datums) in a table.</p>
      <p>JSON data is subject to the same concurrency-control considerations as any other data type
        when stored in a table. Although storing large documents is practicable, keep in mind that
        any update acquires a row-level lock on the whole row. Consider limiting JSON documents to a
        manageable size in order to decrease lock contention among updating transactions. Ideally,
        JSON documents should each represent an atomic datum that business rules dictate cannot
        reasonably be further subdivided into smaller datums that could be modified
        independently.</p>

    <title>jsonb Containment and Existence</title>
    <body>
      <p>Testing <i>containment</i> is an important capability of <codeph>jsonb</codeph>. There is
        no parallel set of facilities for the <codeph>json</codeph> type. Containment tests whether
        one <codeph>jsonb</codeph> document has contained within it another one. These examples
        return true except as noted:</p>
      <codeblock>-- Simple scalar/primitive values contain only the identical value:
SELECT '"foo"'::jsonb @> '"foo"'::jsonb;

-- The array on the right side is contained within the one on the left:
SELECT '[1, 2, 3]'::jsonb @> '[1, 3]'::jsonb;

-- Order of array elements is not significant, so this is also true:
SELECT '[1, 2, 3]'::jsonb @> '[3, 1]'::jsonb;

-- Duplicate array elements don't matter either:
SELECT '[1, 2, 3]'::jsonb @> '[1, 2, 2]'::jsonb;

-- The object with a single pair on the right side is contained
-- within the object on the left side:
SELECT '{"product": "Greenplum", "version": "7.0.0", "jsonb":true}'::jsonb @> '{"version":"7.0.0"}'::jsonb;

-- The array on the right side is <b>not</b> considered contained within the
-- array on the left, even though a similar array is nested within it:
SELECT '[1, 2, [1, 3]]'::jsonb @> '[1, 3]'::jsonb;  -- yields false

-- But with a layer of nesting, it is contained:
SELECT '[1, 2, [1, 3]]'::jsonb @> '[[1, 3]]'::jsonb;

-- Similarly, containment is not reported here:
SELECT '{"foo": {"bar": "baz", "zig": "zag"}}'::jsonb @> '{"bar": "baz"}'::jsonb; -- yields false

-- But with a layer of nesting, it is contained:
SELECT '{"foo": {"bar": "baz", "zig": "zag"}}'::jsonb @> '{"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}'::jsonb;</codeblock>
      <p>The general principle is that the contained object must match the containing object as to
        structure and data contents, possibly after discarding some non-matching array elements or
        object key/value pairs from the containing object. For containment, the order of array
        elements is not significant when doing a containment match, and duplicate array elements are
        effectively considered only once.</p>
      <p>As an exception to the general principle that the structures must match, an array may
        contain a primitive value:</p>
      <codeblock>-- This array contains the primitive string value:
SELECT '["foo", "bar"]'::jsonb @> '"bar"'::jsonb;

-- This exception is not reciprocal -- non-containment is reported here:
SELECT '"bar"'::jsonb @> '["bar"]'::jsonb;  -- yields false</codeblock>
      <p><codeph>jsonb</codeph> also has an <i>existence</i> operator, which is a variation on the
        theme of containment: it tests whether a string (given as a text value) appears as an object
        key or array element at the top level of the <codeph>jsonb</codeph> value. These examples
        return true except as noted:</p>
      <codeblock>-- String exists as array element:
SELECT '["foo", "bar", "baz"]'::jsonb ? 'bar';

-- String exists as object key:
SELECT '{"foo": "bar"}'::jsonb ? 'foo';

-- Object values are not considered:
SELECT '{"foo": "bar"}'::jsonb ? 'bar';  -- yields false

-- As with containment, existence must match at the top level:
SELECT '{"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}'::jsonb ? 'bar'; -- yields false

-- A string is considered to exist if it matches a primitive JSON string:
SELECT '"foo"'::jsonb ? 'foo';</codeblock>
      <p>JSON objects are better suited than arrays for testing containment or existence when there
        are many keys or elements involved, because unlike arrays they are internally optimized for
        searching, and do not need to be searched linearly.</p>
      <p>The various containment and existence operators, along with all other JSON operators and
        functions are documented in <xref href="#topic_gn4_x3w_mq" format="dita"/>.</p>
      <p>Because JSON containment is nested, an appropriate query can skip explicit selection of
        sub-objects. As an example, suppose that we have a doc column containing objects at the top
        level, with most objects containing tags fields that contain arrays of sub-objects. This
        query finds entries in which sub-objects containing both <codeph>"term":"paris"</codeph> and
          <codeph>"term":"food"</codeph> appear, while ignoring any such keys outside the tags
        array:</p>
      <codeblock>SELECT doc->'site_name' FROM websites
  WHERE doc @> '{"tags":[{"term":"paris"}, {"term":"food"}]}';</codeblock>
      <p>The query with this predicate could accomplish the same thing.</p>
      <codeblock>SELECT doc->'site_name' FROM websites
  WHERE doc->'tags' @> '[{"term":"paris"}, {"term":"food"}]';</codeblock>
      <p>However, the second approach is less flexible and is often less efficient as well.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the JSON existence operator is not nested: it will only look for the
        specified key or array element at top level of the JSON value.</p>

        <p>GIN indexes can be used to efficiently search for keys or key/value pairs occurring

            <xref href="#topic_o5y_14w_2z/table_dcb_y3w_mq" format="dita"/>.) An example of creating

        <p>The non-default GIN operator class <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph> supports indexing the

        <pre>CREATE INDEX idxginp ON api USING gin (jdoc jsonb_path_ops);</pre>
        <p>Consider the example of a table that stores JSON documents retrieved from a third-party
          web service, with a documented schema definition. This is a typical document:</p>
        <codeblock>{
    "guid": "9c36adc1-7fb5-4d5b-83b4-90356a46061a",
    "name": "Angela Barton",
    "is_active": true,
    "company": "Magnafone",

        <p>The JSON documents are stored a table named <codeph>api</codeph>, in a
            <codeph>jsonb</codeph> column named <codeph>jdoc</codeph>. If a GIN index is created on
          this column, queries like the following can make use of the index:</p>
        <codeblock>-- Find documents in which the key "company" has value "Magnafone"
SELECT jdoc->'guid', jdoc->'name' FROM api WHERE jdoc @> '{"company": "Magnafone"}';</codeblock>
        <p>However, the index could not be used for queries like the following. The operator
            <codeph>?</codeph> is indexable, however, the comparison is not applied directly to the
          indexed column <codeph>jdoc</codeph>:</p>
        <codeblock>-- Find documents in which the key "tags" contains key or array element "qui"
SELECT jdoc->'guid', jdoc->'name' FROM api WHERE jdoc -> 'tags' ? 'qui';</codeblock>
        <p>With appropriate use of expression indexes, the above query can use an index. If querying
          for particular items within the <codeph>tags</codeph> key is common, defining an index
          like this might be worthwhile:</p>
        <codeblock>CREATE INDEX idxgintags ON api USING gin ((jdoc -> 'tags'));</codeblock>
        <p>Now, the <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause <codeph>jdoc -> 'tags' ? 'qui'</codeph> is
          recognized as an application of the indexable operator <codeph>?</codeph> to the indexed
          expression <codeph>jdoc -> 'tags'</codeph>. For information about expression indexes, see
            <xref href="../../ddl/ddl-index.xml#topic_tfz_3vz_4fb"/>.</p>
        <p>Another approach to querying JSON documents is to exploit containment, for example:</p>
        <pre>-- Find documents in which the key "tags" contains array element "qui"
SELECT jdoc->'guid', jdoc->'name' FROM api WHERE jdoc @> '{"tags": ["qui"]}';
</pre>
        <p>A simple GIN index on the <codeph>jdoc</codeph> column can support this query. However,
          the index will store copies of every key and value in the <codeph>jdoc</codeph> column,
          whereas the expression index of the previous example stores only data found under the tags
          key. While the simple-index approach is far more flexible (since it supports queries about
          any key), targeted expression indexes are likely to be smaller and faster to search than a
          simple index.</p>
        <p>Although the <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph> operator class supports only queries with
          the <codeph>@></codeph> operator, it has performance advantages over the default operator
          class <codeph>jsonb_ops</codeph>. A <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph> index is usually much
          smaller than a <codeph>jsonb_ops</codeph> index over the same data, and the specificity of
          searches is better, particularly when queries contain keys that appear frequently in the
          data. Therefore search operations typically perform better than with the default operator
          class.</p>
        <p>The technical difference between a <codeph>jsonb_ops</codeph> and a
            <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph> GIN index is that the former creates independent index
          items for each key and value in the data, while the latter creates index items only for
          each value in the data.</p>
        <note>For this discussion, the term <i>value</i> includes array elements, though JSON
          terminology sometimes considers array elements distinct from values within objects.</note>
        <p>Basically, each <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph> index item is a hash of the value and the
          key(s) leading to it; for example to index <codeph>{"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}</codeph>, a
          single index item would be created incorporating all three of <codeph>foo</codeph>,
            <codeph>bar</codeph>, and <codeph>baz</codeph> into the hash value. Thus a containment
          query looking for this structure would result in an extremely specific index search; but
          there is no way at all to find out whether <codeph>foo</codeph> appears as a key. On the
          other hand, a <codeph>jsonb_ops</codeph> index would create three index items representing
            <codeph>foo</codeph>, <codeph>bar</codeph>, and <codeph>baz</codeph> separately; then to
          do the containment query, it would look for rows containing all three of these items.
          While GIN indexes can perform such an <codeph>AND</codeph> search fairly efficiently, it
          will still be less specific and slower than the equivalent <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph>
          search, especially if there are a very large number of rows containing any single one of
          the three index items.</p>
        <p>A disadvantage of the <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph> approach is that it produces no
          index entries for JSON structures not containing any values, such as <codeph>{"a":
            {}}</codeph>. If a search for documents containing such a structure is requested, it
          will require a full-index scan, which is quite slow. <codeph>jsonb_path_ops</codeph> is
          ill-suited for applications that often perform such searches.</p>

        <p><codeph>jsonb</codeph> also supports <codeph>btree</codeph> and <codeph>hash</codeph>
          indexes. These are usually useful only when it is important to check the equality of

        <p>For completeness the <codeph>btree</codeph> ordering for <codeph>jsonb</codeph> datums
          is:</p>
        <pre>Object > Array > Boolean > Number > String > Null

Object with n pairs > object with n - 1 pairs

Array with n elements > array with n - 1 elements</pre>
        <p>Objects with equal numbers of pairs are compared in the order:</p>
        <pre>key-1, value-1, key-2 ...</pre>
        <p>Object keys are compared in their storage order. In particular, since shorter keys are
          stored before longer keys, this can lead to orderings that might not be intuitive, such
          as:</p>
        <pre>{ "aa": 1, "c": 1} > {"b": 1, "d": 1}</pre>
        <p>Similarly, arrays with equal numbers of elements are compared in the order:</p>
        <pre>element-1, element-2 ...</pre>
        <p>Primitive JSON values are compared using the same comparison rules as for the underlying

        <note>There are parallel variants of these operators for both the <codeph>json</codeph> and
            <codeph>jsonb</codeph> data types. The field, element, and path extraction operators
          return the same data type as their left-hand input (either <codeph>json</codeph> or
            <codeph>jsonb</codeph>), except for those specified as returning <codeph>text</codeph>,
          which coerce the value to <codeph>text</codeph>. The field, element, and path extraction
          operators return <codeph>NULL</codeph>, rather than failing, if the JSON input does not
          have the right structure to match the request; for example if no such element
          exists.</note>

              constants. However, the typical use would be to reference a table in the

                <codeph>jsonb</codeph> columns as an argument to the function. The extracted key
              values can then be referenced in other parts of the query. For example the value can

                some types. JSON fields that do not appear in the target row type will be omitted
                from the output, and target columns that do not match any JSON field will be
