  <body>
    <p>Greenplum Database 6 supports upgrading from a Greenplum 6.x release to a newer 6.x release.
      Direct upgrade from Tanzu Greenplum 5.28 and later to Tanzu Greenplum 6.9 and later is
      provided via gpupgrade; for more information, see the <xref
        href="https://greenplum.docs.pivotal.io/upgrade/" format="html" scope="external">gpupgrade
        documentation</xref>. Direct upgrade from Greenplum Database 4.3, or from Greenplum 5.27 and
      earlier, to Greenplum 6 is not supported; you must migrate the data to Greenplum 6.</p>
