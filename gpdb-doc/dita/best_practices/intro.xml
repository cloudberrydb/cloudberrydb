    <p><cite>Greenplum Database Best Practices Guide</cite> describes best practices for Greenplum
      Database. A best practice is a method or technique that has consistently shown results
      superior to those achieved with other means. Best practices are found through experience and
      are proven to reliably lead to a desired result. Best practices are a commitment to use any
      product correctly and optimally, by leveraging all the knowledge and expertise available to
      ensure success. </p>
    <p>This document does not teach you how to use Greenplum Database features. Refer to the
      Greenplum Database documentation at <xref href="http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io" format="html"
        scope="external"/> for information on how to use and implement specific Greenplum Database
      features. This document addresses the most important best practices to follow when designing,
      implementing, and using Greenplum Database. </p>
    <p>It is not the intent of this document to cover the entire product or compendium of features
      but to provide a summary of <i>what matters most</i> in Greenplum Database. This document does
      not address <i>edge</i> use cases that can further leverage and benefit from these Greenplum
      Database features. Edge use cases require a proficient knowledge and expertise of these
      features and a deep understanding of your environment including SQL access, query execution,
      concurrency, workload, and other factors. </p>
    <p>By mastering these best practices you will increase the success of your Greenplum Database
      clusters in the areas of maintenance, support, performance and scalability. </p>
