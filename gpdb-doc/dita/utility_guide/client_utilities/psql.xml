      <p><codeph>psql</codeph> is a terminal-based front-end to Greenplum Database. It enables you
        to type in queries interactively, issue them to Greenplum Database, and see the query
        results. Alternatively, input can be from a file. In addition, it provides a number of
        meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a
        wide variety of tasks.</p>

      <title>Options</title>
      <parml>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-a | --echo-all</pt>
          <pd>Print all input lines to standard output as they are read. This is more useful for
            script processing rather than interactive mode.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-A | --no-align</pt>
          <pd>Switches to unaligned output mode. (The default output mode is aligned.) </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-c '<varname>command</varname>' | --command '<varname>command'</varname></pt>
          <pd>Specifies that <codeph>psql</codeph> is to execute the specified command string, and
            then exit. This is useful in shell scripts. <varname>command</varname> must be either a
            command string that is completely parseable by the server, or a single backslash
            command. Thus you cannot mix SQL and <codeph>psql</codeph> meta-commands with this
            option. To achieve that, you could pipe the string into <codeph>psql</codeph>, like
            this:<codeblock>echo '\x \\ SELECT * FROM foo;' | psql</codeblock></pd>
          <pd>(<codeph>\\</codeph> is the separator meta-command.) </pd>
          <pd>If the command string contains multiple SQL commands, they are processed in a single
            transaction, unless there are explicit <codeph>BEGIN/COMMIT</codeph> commands included
            in the string to divide it into multiple transactions. This is different from the
            behavior when the same string is fed to <codeph>psql</codeph>'s standard input.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-d <varname>dbname</varname> | --dbname <varname>dbname</varname></pt>
          <pd>Specifies the name of the database to connect to. This is equivalent to specifying
            dbname as the first non-option argument on the command line.</pd>
          <pd>If this parameter contains an equals sign, it is treated as a
              <codeph>conninfo</codeph> string; for example you can pass <codeph>'dbname=postgres
              user=username password=mypass'</codeph> as <codeph>dbname</codeph>.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-e | --echo-queries</pt>
          <pd>Copy all SQL commands sent to the server to standard output as well.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-E | --echo-hidden</pt>
          <pd>Echo the actual queries generated by <codeph>\d</codeph> and other backslash commands.
            You can use this to study <codeph>psql</codeph>'s internal operations.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-f <varname>filename</varname> | --file <varname>filename</varname></pt>
          <pd>Use a file as the source of commands instead of reading commands interactively. After
            the file is processed, <codeph>psql</codeph> terminates. If <varname>filename</varname>
            is <codeph>-</codeph> (hyphen), then standard input is read. Using this option is subtly
            different from writing <codeph>psql &lt;</codeph><varname>filename</varname>. In
            general, both will do what you expect, but using <codeph>-f</codeph> enables some nice
            features such as error messages with line numbers.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-F <varname>separator</varname> | --field-separator <varname>separator</varname></pt>
          <pd>Use the specified separator as the field separator for unaligned output. </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-H | --html</pt>
          <pd>Turn on HTML tabular output.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-l | --list</pt>
          <pd>List all available databases, then exit. Other non-connection options are
            ignored.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-L <varname>filename</varname> | --log-file <varname>filename</varname></pt>
          <pd>Write all query output into the specified log file, in addition to the normal output
            destination.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-o <varname>filename</varname> | --output <varname>filename</varname></pt>
          <pd>Put all query output into the specified file.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-P <varname>assignment</varname> | --pset <varname>assignment</varname></pt>
          <pd>Allows you to specify printing options in the style of <codeph>\pset</codeph> on the
            command line. Note that here you have to separate name and value with an equal sign
            instead of a space. Thus to set the output format to LaTeX, you could write <codeph>-P
              format=latex</codeph>. </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-q | --quiet</pt>
          <pd>Specifies that <codeph>psql</codeph> should do its work quietly. By default, it prints
            welcome messages and various informational output. If this option is used, none of this
            happens. This is useful with the <codeph>-c</codeph> option.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-R <varname>separator</varname> | --record-separator <varname>separator</varname></pt>
          <pd>Use <varname>separator</varname> as the record separator for unaligned output.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-s | --single-step</pt>
          <pd>Run in single-step mode. That means the user is prompted before each command is sent
            to the server, with the option to cancel execution as well. Use this to debug scripts.
          </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-S | --single-line</pt>
          <pd>Runs in single-line mode where a new line terminates an SQL command, as a semicolon
            does.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-t | --tuples-only</pt>
          <pd>Turn off printing of column names and result row count footers, etc. This command is
            equivalent to <codeph>\pset tuples_only</codeph> and is provided for convenience. </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-T <varname>table_options</varname> | --table-attr
            <varname>table_options</varname></pt>
          <pd>Allows you to specify options to be placed within the HTML table tag. See
              <codeph>\pset</codeph> for details. </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-v <varname>assignment</varname> | --set <varname>assignment</varname> | --variable
              <varname>assignment</varname></pt>
          <pd>Perform a variable assignment, like the <codeph>\set</codeph> internal command. Note
            that you must separate name and value, if any, by an equal sign on the command line. To
            unset a variable, leave off the equal sign. To just set a variable without a value, use
            the equal sign but leave off the value. These assignments are done during a very early
            stage of start-up, so variables reserved for internal purposes might get overwritten
            later.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-V | --version</pt>
          <pd>Print the <codeph>psql</codeph> version and exit. </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-x | --expanded</pt>
          <pd>Turn on the expanded table formatting mode.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-X | --no-psqlrc</pt>
          <pd>Do not read the start-up file (neither the system-wide <codeph>psqlrc</codeph> file
            nor the user's <codeph>~/.psqlrc</codeph> file). </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>-1 | --single-transaction</pt>
          <pd>When <codeph>psql</codeph> executes a script with the <codeph>-f</codeph> option,
            adding this option wraps <codeph>BEGIN/COMMIT</codeph> around the script to execute it
            as a single transaction. This ensures that either all the commands complete
            successfully, or no changes are applied.</pd>
          <pd>If the script itself uses <codeph>BEGIN</codeph>, <codeph>COMMIT</codeph>, or
              <codeph>ROLLBACK</codeph>, this option will not have the desired effects. Also, if the
            script contains any command that cannot be executed inside a transaction block,
            specifying this option will cause that command (and hence the whole transaction) to
            fail.</pd>

      <title>Usage</title>
      <sectiondiv id="section8">
        <b>Connecting to a Database</b>
        <p><codeph>psql</codeph> is a client application for Greenplum Database. In order to connect
          to a database you need to know the name of your target database, the host name and port
          number of the Greenplum master server and what database user name you want to connect as.
            <codeph>psql</codeph> can be told about those parameters via command line options,
          namely <codeph>-d</codeph>, <codeph>-h</codeph>, <codeph>-p</codeph>, and
            <codeph>-U</codeph> respectively. If an argument is found that does not belong to any
          option it will be interpreted as the database name (or the user name, if the database name
          is already given). Not all these options are required; there are useful defaults. If you
          omit the host name, <codeph>psql</codeph> will connect via a UNIX-domain socket to a
          master server on the local host, or via TCP/IP to <codeph>localhost</codeph> on machines
          that do not have UNIX-domain sockets. The default master port number is 5432. If you use a
          different port for the master, you must specify the port. The default database user name
          is your UNIX user name, as is the default database name. Note that you cannot just connect
          to any database under any user name. Your database administrator should have informed you
          about your access rights.</p>
        <p>When the defaults are not right, you can save yourself some typing by setting any or all
          of the environment variables <codeph>PGAPPNAME</codeph>, <codeph>PGDATABASE</codeph>,
            <codeph>PGHOST</codeph>, <codeph>PGPORT</codeph>, and <codeph>PGUSER</codeph> to
          appropriate values. </p>
        <p>It is also convenient to have a <codeph>~/.pgpass</codeph> file to avoid regularly having
          to type in passwords. This file should reside in your home directory and contain lines of
          the following format:</p>
        <codeblock><varname>hostname</varname>:<varname>port</varname>:<varname>database</varname>:<varname>username</varname>:<varname>password</varname></codeblock>
        <p>The permissions on <codeph>.pgpass</codeph> must disallow any access to world or group
          (for example: <codeph>chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass</codeph>). If the permissions are less strict
          than this, the file will be ignored. (The file permissions are not currently checked on
          Microsoft Windows clients, however.)</p>
        <p>If the connection could not be made for any reason (insufficient privileges, server is
          not running, etc.), <codeph>psql</codeph> will return an error and terminate.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv id="section9">
        <b>Entering SQL Commands</b>
        <p>In normal operation, <codeph>psql</codeph> provides a prompt with the name of the
          database to which <codeph>psql</codeph> is currently connected, followed by the string
            <b>=&gt;</b> for a regular user or <b>=#</b> for a superuser. For example:</p>
        <codeblock>testdb=&gt;
testdb=#</codeblock>
        <p>At the prompt, the user may type in SQL commands. Ordinarily, input lines are sent to the
          server when a command-terminating semicolon is reached. An end of line does not terminate
          a command. Thus commands can be spread over several lines for clarity. If the command was
          sent and executed without error, the results of the command are displayed on the
          screen.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
    </section>
    <section id="section10">
      <title>Meta-Commands</title>
      <p>Anything you enter in <codeph>psql</codeph> that begins with an unquoted backslash is a
          <codeph>psql</codeph> meta-command that is processed by <codeph>psql</codeph> itself.
        These commands help make <codeph>psql</codeph> more useful for administration or scripting.
        Meta-commands are more commonly called slash or backslash commands. </p>
      <p>The format of a <codeph>psql</codeph> command is the backslash, followed immediately by a
        command verb, then any arguments. The arguments are separated from the command verb and each
        other by any number of whitespace characters.</p>
      <p>To include whitespace into an argument you may quote it with a single quote. To include a
        single quote into such an argument, use two single quotes. Anything contained in single
        quotes is furthermore subject to C-like substitutions for <codeph>\n</codeph> (new line),
          <codeph>\t</codeph> (tab), <codeph>\digits</codeph> (octal), and <codeph>\xdigits</codeph>
        (hexadecimal). </p>
      <p>If an unquoted argument begins with a colon (<codeph>:</codeph>), it is taken as a
          <codeph>psql</codeph> variable and the value of the variable is used as the argument
        instead.</p>
      <p>Arguments that are enclosed in backquotes (<codeph>`</codeph>) are taken as a command line
        that is passed to the shell. The output of the command (with any trailing newline removed)
        is taken as the argument value. The above escape sequences also apply in backquotes. </p>
      <p>Some commands take an SQL identifier (such as a table name) as argument. These arguments
        follow the syntax rules of SQL: Unquoted letters are forced to lowercase, while double
        quotes (<codeph>"</codeph>) protect letters from case conversion and allow incorporation of
        whitespace into the identifier. Within double quotes, paired double quotes reduce to a
        single double quote in the resulting name. For example, <codeph>FOO"BAR"BAZ</codeph> is
        interpreted as <codeph>fooBARbaz</codeph>, and <codeph>"A weird"" name"</codeph> becomes
          <codeph>A weird" name</codeph>. </p>
      <p>Parsing for arguments stops when another unquoted backslash occurs. This is taken as the
        beginning of a new meta-command. The special sequence <codeph>\\</codeph> (two backslashes)
        marks the end of arguments and continues parsing SQL commands, if any. That way SQL and
          <codeph>psql</codeph> commands can be freely mixed on a line. But in any case, the
        arguments of a meta-command cannot continue beyond the end of the line.</p>
      <p>The following meta-commands are defined:</p>
      <parml>
        <plentry>
          <pt>\a</pt>
          <pd>If the current table output format is unaligned, it is switched to aligned. If it is
            not unaligned, it is set to unaligned. This command is kept for backwards compatibility.
            See <codeph>\pset</codeph> for a more general solution. </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>\cd [<varname>directory</varname>]</pt>
          <pd>Changes the current working directory. Without argument, changes to the current user's
            home directory. To print your current working directory, use <codeph>\!pwd</codeph>.
          </pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>\C [<varname>title</varname>]</pt>
          <pd>Sets the title of any tables being printed as the result of a query or unset any such
            title. This command is equivalent to <codeph>\pset title</codeph>.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>\c | \connect [<varname>dbname</varname> [<varname>username</varname>]
              [<varname>host</varname>] [<varname>port</varname>]]</pt>
          <pd>Establishes a new connection. If the new connection is successfully made, the previous
            connection is closed. If any of dbname, username, host or port are omitted, the value of
            that parameter from the previous connection is used. If the connection attempt failed,

              <li id="kb144082"><b><codeph>format</codeph></b> – Sets the output format to one of
                  <b>u</b><codeph>naligned</codeph>, <b>a</b><codeph>ligned</codeph>,
                  <b>h</b><codeph>tml</codeph>, <b>l</b><codeph>atex</codeph>,
                  <b>t</b><codeph>roff-ms</codeph>, or <b>w</b><codeph>rapped</codeph>. First letter
                abbreviations are allowed. Unaligned writes all columns of a row on a line,
                separated by the currently active field separator. This is intended to create output
                that might be intended to be read in by other programs. Aligned mode is the
                standard, human-readable, nicely formatted text output that is default. The HTML and
                LaTeX modes put out tables that are intended to be included in documents using the
                respective mark-up language. They are not complete documents! (This might not be so
                dramatic in HTML, but in LaTeX you must have a complete document wrapper.) <p>The
                  wrapped option sets the output format like the <codeph>aligned</codeph> parameter
                  , but wraps wide data values across lines to make the output fit in the target
                  column width. The target width is set with the <codeph>columns</codeph> option. To
                  specify the column width and select the wrapped format, use two \pset commands;
                  for example, to set the with to 72 columns and specify wrapped format, use the
                  commands <codeph>\pset columns 72</codeph> and then <codeph>\pset format
                    wrapped</codeph>.</p><note>Since <codeph>psql</codeph> does not attempt to wrap
                  column header titles, the wrapped format behaves the same as aligned if the total
                  width needed for column headers exceeds the target. </note></li>
              <li id="kb144087"><b><codeph>border</codeph></b> – The second argument must be a
                number. In general, the higher the number the more borders and lines the tables will
                have, but this depends on the particular format. In HTML mode, this will translate
                directly into the <codeph>border=...</codeph> attribute, in the others only values
                  <codeph>0</codeph> (no border), <codeph>1</codeph> (internal dividing lines), and
                  <codeph>2</codeph> (table frame) make sense.</li>
              <li id="kb151382"><b><codeph>columns</codeph></b> – Sets the target width for the
                  <codeph>wrapped</codeph> format, and also the width limit for determining whether
                output is wide enough to require the pager. The default is <varname>zero</varname>.
                Zero causes the target width to be controlled by the environment variable
                  <codeph>COLUMNS</codeph>, or the detected screen width if <codeph>COLUMNS</codeph>
                is not set. In addition, if <codeph>columns</codeph> is zero then the wrapped format
                affects screen output only. If columns is nonzero then file and pipe output is
                wrapped to that width as well. <p>After setting the target width, use the command
                    <codeph>\pset format wrapped</codeph> to enable the wrapped format.</p></li>
              <li id="kb144090"><b><codeph>expanded</codeph></b> | <b><codeph>x</codeph></b> –
                Toggles between regular and expanded format. When expanded format is enabled, query
                results are displayed in two columns, with the column name on the left and the data
                on the right. This mode is useful if the data would not fit on the screen in the
                normal horizontal mode. Expanded mode is supported by all four output formats.</li>

                    <b><codeph>ascii</codeph></b> | <b><codeph>old-ascii</codeph></b>] – Sets the
                border line drawing style to one of unicode, ascii, or old-ascii. Unique
                abbreviations, including one letter, are allowed for the three styles. The default
                setting is <codeph>ascii</codeph>. This option only affects the
                  <codeph>aligned</codeph> and <codeph>wrapped</codeph> output formats.
                      <p><b><codeph>ascii</codeph></b> – uses plain ASCII characters. Newlines in
                  data are shown using a + symbol in the right-hand margin. When the wrapped format
                  wraps data from one line to the next without a newline character, a dot (.) is
                  shown in the right-hand margin of the first line, and again in the left-hand
                  margin of the following line. </p><p><b><codeph>old-ascii</codeph></b> – style
                  uses plain ASCII characters, using the formatting style used in PostgreSQL 8.4 and
                  earlier. Newlines in data are shown using a : symbol in place of the left-hand
                  column separator. When the data is wrapped from one line to the next without a
                  newline character, a ; symbol is used in place of the left-hand column separator.
                      </p><p><b><codeph>unicode</codeph></b> – style uses Unicode box-drawing
                  characters. Newlines in data are shown using a carriage return symbol in the
                  right-hand margin. When the data is wrapped from one line to the next without a
                  newline character, an ellipsis symbol is shown in the right-hand margin of the
                  first line, and again in the left-hand margin of the following line. </p><p>When
                  the <codeph>border</codeph> setting is greater than zero, this option also
                  determines the characters with which the border lines are drawn. Plain ASCII
                  characters work everywhere, but Unicode characters look nicer on displays that
                  recognize them. </p></li>
              <li id="kb144095"><b><codeph>null 'string'</codeph></b> – The second argument is a
                string to print whenever a column is null. The default is not to print anything,
                which can easily be mistaken for an empty string. For example, the command
                  <codeph>\pset</codeph><codeph>null '(empty)' </codeph>displays
                  <varname>(empty)</varname> in null columns.</li>
              <li id="kb147007"><b><codeph>fieldsep</codeph></b> – Specifies the field separator to
                be used in unaligned output mode. That way one can create, for example, tab- or
                comma-separated output, which other programs might prefer. To set a tab as field
                separator, type <codeph>\pset fieldsep '\t'</codeph>. The default field separator is
                  <codeph>'|'</codeph> (a vertical bar). </li>
              <li id="kb147023"><b><codeph>footer</codeph></b> – Toggles the display of the default
                footer (<varname>x</varname> rows). </li>
              <li id="kb147036"><b><codeph>numericlocale</codeph></b> – Toggles the display of a
                locale-aware character to separate groups of digits to the left of the decimal
                marker. It also enables a locale-aware decimal marker. </li>
              <li id="kb147046"><b><codeph>recordsep</codeph></b> – Specifies the record (line)
                separator to use in unaligned output mode. The default is a newline character. </li>
              <li id="kb147069"><b><codeph>title</codeph></b> [<varname>text</varname>] – Sets the
                table title for any subsequently printed tables. This can be used to give your

                  [<varname>text</varname>] – Allows you to specify any attributes to be placed
                inside the HTML table tag. This could for example be <codeph>cellpadding</codeph> or
                  <codeph>bgcolor</codeph>. Note that you probably don't want to specify border

                The <codeph>\pset tuples_only</codeph> command by itselt toggles between tuples only
                and full display. The values <varname>on</varname> and <varname>off</varname> set
                the tuples display, regardless of the current setting. Full display may show extra
                information such as column headers, titles, and various footers. In tuples only
                mode, only actual table data is shown The <codeph>\t</codeph> command is equivalent

      <title>Patterns</title>
      <p>The various <codeph>\d</codeph> commands accept a pattern parameter to specify the object
        name(s) to be displayed. In the simplest case, a pattern is just the exact name of the
        object. The characters within a pattern are normally folded to lower case, just as in SQL
        names; for example, <codeph>\dt FOO</codeph> will display the table named
          <codeph>foo</codeph>. As in SQL names, placing double quotes around a pattern stops
        folding to lower case. Should you need to include an actual double quote character in a
        pattern, write it as a pair of double quotes within a double-quote sequence; again this is
        in accord with the rules for SQL quoted identifiers. For example, <codeph>\dt
          "FOO""BAR"</codeph> will display the table named <codeph>FOO"BAR</codeph> (not
          <codeph>foo"bar</codeph>). Unlike the normal rules for SQL names, you can put double
        quotes around just part of a pattern, for instance <codeph>\dt FOO"FOO"BAR</codeph> will
        display the table named <codeph>fooFOObar</codeph>. </p>
      <p>Within a pattern, <codeph>*</codeph> matches any sequence of characters (including no
        characters) and <codeph>?</codeph> matches any single character. (This notation is
        comparable to UNIX shell file name patterns.) For example, <codeph>\dt int*</codeph>
        displays all tables whose names begin with <codeph>int</codeph>. But within double quotes,
          <codeph>*</codeph> and <codeph>?</codeph> lose these special meanings and are just matched
        literally.</p>
      <p>A pattern that contains a dot (<codeph>.</codeph>) is interpreted as a schema name pattern
        followed by an object name pattern. For example, <codeph>\dt foo*.bar*</codeph> displays all
        tables whose table name starts with <codeph>bar</codeph> that are in schemas whose schema
        name starts with <codeph>foo</codeph>. When no dot appears, then the pattern matches only
        objects that are visible in the current schema search path. Again, a dot within double
        quotes loses its special meaning and is matched literally.</p>
      <p>Advanced users can use regular-expression notations. All regular expression special
        characters work as specified in the <xref
          href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP"
          scope="external" format="html">PostgreSQL documentation on regular expressions</xref>,
        except for <codeph>.</codeph> which is taken as a separator as mentioned above,
          <codeph>*</codeph> which is translated to the regular-expression notation
          <codeph>.*</codeph>, and <codeph>?</codeph> which is translated to <codeph>..</codeph> You
        can emulate these pattern characters at need by writing <codeph>?</codeph> for
          <codeph>.,</codeph><codeph>(R+|)</codeph> for <codeph>R*</codeph>, or
          <codeph>(R|)</codeph> for <codeph>R?</codeph>. Remember that the pattern must match the
        whole name, unlike the usual interpretation of regular expressions; write <codeph>*</codeph>
        at the beginning and/or end if you don't wish the pattern to be anchored. Note that within
        double quotes, all regular expression special characters lose their special meanings and are
        matched literally. Also, the regular expression special characters are matched literally in
        operator name patterns (such as the argument of <codeph>\do</codeph>).</p>
      <p>Whenever the pattern parameter is omitted completely, the <codeph>\d</codeph> commands
        display all objects that are visible in the current schema search path – this is equivalent
        to using the pattern <codeph>*.</codeph> To see all objects in the database, use the pattern
          <codeph>*.*.</codeph></p>

        <b>Variables</b>
        <p><codeph>psql</codeph> provides variable substitution features similar to common UNIX
          command shells. Variables are simply name/value pairs, where the value can be any string
          of any length. To set variables, use the <codeph>psql</codeph> meta-command
            <codeph>\set</codeph>:</p>
        <codeblock>testdb=&gt; \set foo bar</codeblock>
        <p>sets the variable <codeph>foo</codeph> to the value <codeph>bar</codeph>. To retrieve the
          content of the variable, precede the name with a colon and use it as the argument of any
          slash command:</p>
        <codeblock>testdb=&gt; \echo :foo
bar</codeblock>
        <note>The arguments of <codeph>\set</codeph> are subject to the same substitution rules as
          with other commands. Thus you can construct interesting references such as <codeph>\set
            :foo 'something'</codeph> and get 'soft links' or 'variable variables' of Perl or PHP
          fame, respectively. Unfortunately, there is no way to do anything useful with these
          constructs. On the other hand, <codeph>\set bar :foo</codeph> is a perfectly valid way to
          copy a variable.</note>
        <p>If you call <codeph>\set</codeph> without a second argument, the variable is set, with an
          empty string as <varname>value</varname>. To unset (or delete) a variable, use the command
            <codeph>\unset</codeph>.</p>
        <p><codeph>psql</codeph>'s internal variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and
          underscores in any order and any number of them. A number of these variables are treated
          specially by <codeph>psql</codeph>. They indicate certain option settings that can be
          changed at run time by altering the value of the variable or represent some state of the
          application. Although you can use these variables for any other purpose, this is not
          recommended, as the program behavior might behave unexpectedly. By convention, all
          specially treated variables consist of all upper-case letters (and possibly numbers and
          underscores). To ensure maximum compatibility in the future, avoid using such variable
          names for your own purposes. A list of all specially treated variables are as follows:</p>
        <parml>
          <plentry>
            <pt>AUTOCOMMIT</pt>
            <pd>When on (the default), each SQL command is automatically committed upon successful
              completion. To postpone commit in this mode, you must enter a <codeph>BEGIN</codeph>
              or <codeph>START TRANSACTION</codeph> SQL command. When off or unset, SQL commands are
              not committed until you explicitly issue <codeph>COMMIT</codeph> or
                <codeph>END</codeph>. The autocommit-on mode works by issuing an implicit
                <codeph>BEGIN</codeph> for you, just before any command that is not already in a
              transaction block and is not itself a <codeph>BEGIN</codeph> or other
              transaction-control command, nor a command that cannot be executed inside a
              transaction block (such as <codeph>VACUUM</codeph>). </pd>
            <pd>In autocommit-off mode, you must explicitly abandon any failed transaction by
              entering <codeph>ABORT</codeph> or <codeph>ROLLBACK</codeph>. Also keep in mind that
              if you exit the session without committing, your work will be lost.</pd>
            <pd>The autocommit-on mode is PostgreSQL's traditional behavior, but autocommit-off is
              closer to the SQL spec. If you prefer autocommit-off, you may wish to set it in your

        <b>SQL Interpolation</b>
        <p>An additional useful feature of <codeph>psql</codeph> variables is that you can
          substitute (interpolate) them into regular SQL statements. The syntax for this is again to
          prepend the variable name with a colon (<codeph>:</codeph>).</p>
        <codeblock>testdb=&gt; \set foo 'my_table'
testdb=&gt; SELECT * FROM :foo;</codeblock>
        <p>would then query the table <codeph>my_table</codeph>. The value of the variable is copied
          literally, so it can even contain unbalanced quotes or backslash commands. You must make
          sure that it makes sense where you put it. Variable interpolation will not be performed
          into quoted SQL entities.</p>
        <p>A popular application of this facility is to refer to the last inserted OID in subsequent
          statements to build a foreign key scenario. Another possible use of this mechanism is to
          copy the contents of a file into a table column. First load the file into a variable and
          then proceed as above.</p>
        <codeblock>testdb=&gt; \set content '''' `cat my_file.txt` ''''
testdb=&gt; INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (:content);</codeblock>
        <p>One problem with this approach is that <codeph>my_file.txt</codeph> might contain single
          quotes. These need to be escaped so that they don't cause a syntax error when the second
          line is processed. This could be done with the program <codeph>sed</codeph>:</p>
        <codeblock>testdb=&gt; \set content '''' `sed -e "s/'/''/g" &lt; my_file.txt` 
''''</codeblock>
        <p>If you are using non-standard-conforming strings then you'll also need to double
          backslashes. This is a bit tricky:</p>
        <codeblock>testdb=&gt; \set content '''' `sed -e "s/'/''/g" -e 
's/\\/\\\\/g' &lt; my_file.txt` ''''</codeblock>
        <p>Note the use of different shell quoting conventions so that neither the single quote
          marks nor the backslashes are special to the shell. Backslashes are still special to
            <codeph>sed</codeph>, however, so we need to double them.</p>
        <p>Since colons may legally appear in SQL commands, the following rule applies: the
          character sequence <codeph>":name"</codeph> is not changed unless <codeph>"name"</codeph>
          is the name of a variable that is currently set. In any case you can escape a colon with a
          backslash to protect it from substitution. (The colon syntax for variables is standard SQL
          for embedded query languages, such as ECPG. The colon syntax for array slices and type
          casts are Greenplum Database extensions, hence the conflict.)</p>

          contain strings and special escape sequences that describe the appearance of the prompt.
          Prompt 1 is the normal prompt that is issued when <codeph>psql</codeph> requests a new
          command. Prompt 2 is issued when more input is expected during command input because the
          command was not terminated with a semicolon or a quote was not closed. Prompt 3 is issued

      <p>Before starting up, <codeph>psql</codeph> attempts to read and execute commands from the
        user's <codeph>~/.psqlrc</codeph> file.</p>
      <p>The command-line history is stored in the file <codeph>~/.psql_history</codeph>.</p>

      <p><codeph>psql</codeph> only works smoothly with servers of the same version. That does not
        mean other combinations will fail outright, but subtle and not-so-subtle problems might come
        up. Backslash commands are particularly likely to fail if the server is of a different
        version.</p>

      <title>Notes for Windows users</title>
      <p><codeph>psql</codeph> is built as a console application. Since the Windows console windows
        use a different encoding than the rest of the system, you must take special care when using
        8-bit characters within <codeph>psql</codeph>. If <codeph>psql</codeph> detects a
        problematic console code page, it will warn you at startup. To change the console code page,
        two things are necessary: </p>
      <p>Set the code page by
          entering:<codeblock>cmd.exe /c chcp 1252</codeblock><codeph>1252</codeph> is a character
        encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by Microsoft Windows for English and some other Western
        languages. If you are using Cygwin, you can put this command in
          <codeph>/etc/profile</codeph>. </p>
      <p>Set the console font to Lucida Console, because the raster font does not work with the ANSI
        code page.</p>

      <p>Start <codeph>psql</codeph> in interactive mode:</p>
      <codeblock>psql -p 54321 -U sally mydatabase</codeblock>
      <p>In <codeph>psql</codeph> interactive mode, spread a command over several lines of input.
        Notice the changing prompt:</p>
      <codeblock>testdb=&gt; CREATE TABLE my_table (
testdb(&gt;  first integer not null default 0,
testdb(&gt;  second text)
testdb-&gt; ;
CREATE TABLE</codeblock>
      <p>Look at the table definition:</p>
      <codeblock>testdb=&gt; \d my_table
             Table "my_table"
 Attribute |  Type   |      Modifier
-----------+---------+--------------------
 first     | integer | not null default 0
 second    | text    |</codeblock>
      <p>Run <codeph>psql</codeph> in non-interactive mode by passing in a file containing SQL
        commands:</p>
      <codeblock>psql -f /home/gpadmin/test/myscript.sql</codeblock>
