  <title>passwordcheck</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <codeph>passwordcheck</codeph> module checks users' passwords whenever they are set with
        <codeph>CREATE ROLE</codeph> or <codeph>ALTER ROLE</codeph>. If a password is considered too
      weak, it will be rejected and the command will terminate with an error.</p>
    <p>To enable this module, add <codeph>'$libdir/passwordcheck'</codeph> to
        <codeph>shared_preload_libraries</codeph> in <filepath>postgresql.conf</filepath>, then
      restart the server.</p>
    <p>By default, this module enforces a few simple rules for password strength, which you can
      modify or extend as you see fit. It is also possible to adapt this module to your needs by
      modifying the <filepath>Makefile</filepath> and rebuilding the module. <note
        class="- topic/note " type="caution">To prevent unencrypted passwords from being sent across
        the network, written to the server log, or otherwise stolen by a database administrator,
        Greenplum Database enables you to supply pre-encrypted passwords. Many client programs make
        use of this functionality and encrypt the password before sending it to the server.This
        limits the usefulness of the <codeph>passwordcheck</codeph> module, because in that case it
        can only try to guess the password. For this reason, <codeph>passwordcheck</codeph> is not
        recommended if your security requirements are high. It is more secure to use an external
        authentication method such as Kerberos than to rely on passwords within the database.
        Alternatively, you could modify <codeph>passwordcheck</codeph> to reject pre-encrypted
        passwords, but forcing users to set their passwords in clear text carries its own security
        risks.</note></p>
