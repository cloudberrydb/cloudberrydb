  <body>
    <p>This guide describes how to secure a Greenplum Database system. The guide assumes knowledge
      of Linux/UNIX system administration and database management systems. Familiarity with
      structured query language (SQL) is helpful.</p>
    <p>Because Greenplum Database is based on PostgreSQL8.3.23, this guide assumes some familiarity
      with PostgreSQL. References to <xref
        href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/index.html" scope="external" format="html"
          ><ph>PostgreSQL documentation</ph></xref> are provided throughout this guide for features
      that are similar to those in Greenplum Database.</p>
    <p>This information is intended for system administrators responsible for administering a
      Greenplum Database system.</p>
