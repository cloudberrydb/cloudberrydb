Source code for the Greenplum Database documentation is shared between Greenplum Database and
Pivotal Greenplum Database. Some features of Pivotal Greenplum Database are not present in the
open source Greenplum Database code but are described in the Greenplum Database documentation. 

In general, the term "Pivotal Greenplum Database" refers to Pivotal's commercial, supported
version of Greenplum Database and is used in this documentation when describing features that
are only supported in the commercial Greenplum Database software. The term "Greenplum
Database" refers to features available in both open source Greenplum Database and Pivotal
Greenplum Database. 

Features that are only supported with Pivotal Greenplum Database are noted in sections that
contain primary documentation for the features. 

The following is a list of Pivotal Greenplum Database features that are unsupported in open
source Greenplum Database but may be documented or referenced in this documentation.

- Code to produce the Pivotal Greenplum Database binary installer packages is not included
in the open source Greenplum Database repository. 

- Greenplum Database does not include EMC DD Boost integration. Backing up to an EMC Data
Domain appliance is only supported when the Data Domain system is mounted as an NFS share on
the Greenplum hosts. 

- Greenplum Database does not include Symantec NetBackup integration. 

- To use GPORCA with open source Greenplum Database the software must be compiled with GPORCA enabled. Refer to the build instructions in the README file in the Greenplum Database repository.

- The QuickLZ compression method is not available in Greenplum Database. QuickLZ <codeph>compresstype</codeph> values are ignored when specified in a <codeph>CREATE TABLE
[AS]</codeph> operation, but will cause an error on subsequent <codeph>INSERT</codeph> or
<codeph>SELECT</codeph> operations on the table.

- The deprecated <codeph>gpcheck</codeph> management utility and its replacement <codeph>gpsupport</codeph> are only supported with Pivotal Greenplum Database. 

- Suggestions to contact Pivotal Technical Support in this documentation are intended only for Pivotal Greenplum Database customers.
