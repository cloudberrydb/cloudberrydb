Source code for the Greenplum Database documentation is shared between Greenplum Database and
VMware Tanzu Greenplum. Some features of Tanzu Greenplum are not present in the
open source Greenplum Database code but are described in the Greenplum Database documentation. 

The term "Tanzu Greenplum" refers to VMware's commercial, supported product offering that is 
based on open source Greenplum Database.  "Tanzu Greenplum" is used in this documentation when 
describing features that are available only in the commercial offering. The term "Greenplum
Database" refers to features available in open source Greenplum Database (and in the commercial Tanzu 
Greenplum product). Commercial support for "Greenplum Database" is offered by VMware as "Greenplum Database by VMware Tanzu."

The following is a list of Tanzu Greenplum features that are not provided or supported in open
source Greenplum Database, but may be documented or referenced in this documentation.

- Code to produce the Tanzu Greenplum binary installer packages is not included
in the open source Greenplum Database repository. 

- Greenplum Database does not include EMC DD Boost integration. Backing up to an EMC Data
Domain appliance is only supported when the Data Domain system is mounted as an NFS share on
the Greenplum hosts. 

- Greenplum Database does not include Symantec NetBackup integration. 

- The QuickLZ compression method is not available in Greenplum Database. QuickLZ <codeph>compresstype</codeph> values are ignored when specified in a <codeph>CREATE TABLE
[AS]</codeph> operation, but will cause an error on subsequent <codeph>INSERT</codeph> or
<codeph>SELECT</codeph> operations on the table.

- The deprecated <codeph>gpcheck</codeph> management utility and its replacement <codeph>gpsupport</codeph> are only supported with Tanzu Greenplum. 

- Suggestions to contact VMware Technical Support in this documentation are intended only for Tanzu Greenplum customers. 

Source code for the following open source Greenplum Database components are located in repositories outside of the Greenplum Database repo:

- To use Backup and Restore with open source Greenplum Database, you must separately build and install the backup/restore software. Refer to the build instructions in the [README](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpbackup/blob/master/README.md) file located in the Greenplum Backup and Restore github repository.

- To use the Greenplum Platform Extension Framework (PXF) with open source Greenplum Database, you must separately build and install the PXF software. Refer to the build and packaging instructions in the [PXF Packaging README](https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/blob/master/package/README.md) file located in the PXF github repository.
