The PXF Extension Framework (PXF) provides parallel, high throughput data access and federated queries across heterogeneous data sources via built-in connectors that map a Greenplum Database external table definition to an external data source. This Greenplum Database extension is based on [PXF](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HAWQ/PXF) from Apache HAWQ (incubating).
