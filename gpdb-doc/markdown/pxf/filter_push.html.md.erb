PXF supports filter pushdown. When filter pushdown is enabled, the constraints from the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query can be extracted and passed to the external data source for filtering. This process can improve query performance, and can also reduce the amount of data that is transferred to Greenplum Database.

You enable or disable filter pushdown for all external table protocols, including `pxf`, by setting the `gp_external_enable_filter_pushdown` server configuration parameter. The default value of this configuration parameter is `on`; set it to `off` to disable filter pushdown. For example:

``` sql
SHOW gp_external_enable_filter_pushdown;
SET gp_external_enable_filter_pushdown TO 'on';
```

**Note:** Some external data sources do not support filter pushdown. Also, filter pushdown may not be supported with certain data types or operators. If a query accesses a data source that does not support filter push-down for the query constraints, the query is instead executed without filter pushdown (the data is filtered after it is transferred to Greenplum Database).

PXF accesses data sources using different connectors, and filter pushdown support is determined by the specific connector implementation. The following PXF connectors support filter pushdown:

- Hive Connector
- HBase Connector
- JDBC Connector

PXF filter pushdown can be used with these data types:

- `INT`
- `FLOAT`
- `NUMERIC`
- `BOOL`
- `CHAR`, `TEXT`
- `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP` (JDBC connector only)

PXF filter pushdown can be used with these operators:

- `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`
- `<>`, `=`
- `IN` operator on arrays of `INT` and `TEXT`
- `LIKE` (only for `TEXT` fields) (JDBC connector only)

To summarize, all of the following criteria must be met for filter pushdown to occur:

* You enable external table filter pushdown by setting the `gp_external_enable_filter_pushdown` server configuration parameter to `'on'`.
* The Greenplum Database protocol that you use to access external data source must support filter pushdown. The `pxf` external table protocol supports pushdown.
* The external data source that you are accessing must support pushdown. For example, HBase and Hive support pushdown.
* For queries on external tables that you create with the `pxf` protocol, the underlying PXF connector must also support filter pushdown. For example, the PXF Hive, HBase, and JDBC connectors support pushdown.
