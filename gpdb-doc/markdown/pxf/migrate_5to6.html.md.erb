title: Migrating PXF from Greenplum 5
---

If you are using PXF in your Greenplum Database 5 installation, upgrade Greenplum Database to version **5.21.2** or newer before you migrate PXF to Greenplum Database 6.

The PXF Greenplum Database 5 to 6 migration procedure has two parts. You perform one PXF procedure in your Greenplum Database 5 installation, then install, configure, and migrate data to Greenplum 6:

-   [Step 1: Complete PXF Greenplum Database 5 Pre-Migration Actions](#pxf5pre)
-   [Step 2: Migrate PXF to Greenplum Database 6](#pxfmig)


## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

Before migrating PXF from Greenplum 5 to Greenplum 6, ensure that you can:

- Identify the version number of your Greenplum 5 installation. If it is older than 5.21.2, upgrade to a newer 5.x version.
- Identify the version of PXF running in the Greenplum 5 cluster.
- Determine if you have `gphdfs` external tables defined in your Greenplum 5 installation.
- Identify the file system location of the PXF `$PXF_CONF` directory in your Greenplum 5 installation. In Greenplum 5.15 and later, `$PXF_CONF` identifies the user configuration directory that was provided to the `pxf cluster init` command. This directory contains PXF server configurations, security keytab files, and log files.


## <a id="pxf5pre"></a>Step 1: Complete PXF Greenplum Database 5 Pre-Migration Actions

Perform this procedure in your Greenplum Database 5 installation:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gp5master>
    ```

2. Identify and note the Greenplum Database version number of your 5 installation. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gp5master$ psql -d postgres
    ```

    ``` sql
    SELECT version();

               version

 PostgreSQL 8.3.23 (Greenplum Database 5.21.2 build commit:610b6d777436fe4a281a371cae85ac40f01f4f5e) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by GCC gcc (GCC) 6.2.0, 64-bit compiled on Aug  7 2019 20:38:47
(1 row)
    ```

2. Identify and note the PXF version number. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gp5master$ pxf version
    ```

3. Greenplum 6 removes the `gphdfs` external table protocol. If you have `gphdfs` external tables defined in your Greenplum 5 installation, you must delete or migrate them to `pxf` as described in [Migrating gphdfs External Tables to PXF](gphdfs-pxf-migrate.html).

3. Stop PXF on each segment host as described in [Stopping PXF](../../pxf/5-14/cfginitstart_pxf.html#stop_pxf).

4. If you plan to install Greenplum Database 6 on a new set of hosts, be sure to save a copy of the `$PXF_CONF` directory in your Greenplum 5 installation.

5. Install and configure Greenplum Database 6, migrate Greenplum 5 table definitions and data to your Greenplum 6 installation, and then continue your PXF migration with [Step 2: Migrating PXF to Greenplum 6](#pxfmig).


## <a id="pxfmig"></a>Step 2: Migrating PXF to Greenplum 6

After you install and configure Greenplum Database 6 and migrate table definitions and data from the Greenplum 5 installation, perform the following procedure to configure and start the new PXF software:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database 6 master node. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gp6master>
    ```

2. Identify and note the version number of your Greenplum Database 6 installation.

2. Identify the version of PXF installed on your Greenplum 6 hosts:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gp6master$ pxf version
    ```

3. If the version of PXF installed in your Greenplum 5 installation is newer than the version of PXF installed in your Greenplum 6 cluster, install the PXF distribution on your Greenplum 6 hosts as described in [Installing PXF](../../pxf/5-14/installing_pxf.html). Be sure to install a version of PXF that is the same, or newer, than the version of PXF installed in your Greenplum 5 cluster.

2. If you installed Greenplum Database 6 on a new set of hosts, copy the `$PXF_CONF` directory from your Greenplum 5 installation to the master node. Consider copying the directory to the same file system location at which it resided in the 5 cluster. For example, if `PXF_CONF=/usr/local/greenplum-pxf`:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gp6master$ scp -r gpadmin@<gp5master>:/usr/local/greenplum-pxf /usr/local/
    ```

3. Initialize PXF on each segment host as described in [Initializing PXF](../../pxf/5-14/init_pxf.html), specifying the `PXF_CONF` directory that you copied in the step above.

4. Perform any version-applicable upgrade actions identified in [Step 2](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/5280/pxf/upgrade_pxf.html#pxfup) of the PXF 5.x upgrade documentation in your Greenplum Database 6 installation. **Start with step 6 in the procedure**.

5. Synchronize the PXF configuration from the Greenplum Database 6 master host to the standby master and each segment host in the cluster. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gp6master$ pxf cluster sync
    ```
 
6. Start PXF on each Greenplum Database 6 segment host as described in [Starting PXF](../../pxf/5-14/cfginitstart_pxf.html#start_pxf).

7. Verify the migration by testing that each PXF external table can access the referenced data store.
