 *	  Shared definitions for the Anser adaptive information sharing
 *	  subsystem.
 *
 * Anser lets producers on the segments publish a small piece of information
 * about a running query -- today a bloom filter over a join-build key -- have
 * the coordinator combine the per-segment parts, and hand the result back to
 * consumers on the segments, which use it to prune work.
 *
 * Everything travels over the dispatch connection the coordinator already
 * holds open to each segment (see ansersideband.h), so there is no shared
 * memory, no background worker and no second connection to authenticate: a
 * channel exists only in the coordinator backend running the query, for as
 * long as that query runs.
