-- Test locking behaviour when operating on partitions.
--
-- In previous versions of GPDB, we used to only lock the parent table in
-- many DDL operations. That was always a bit bogus, but we did it to avoid
-- running out of lock space when working on large partition hierarchies. We
-- don't play fast and loose like that anymore, but keep the tests. If a user
-- runs out of lock space, you can work around that by simply bumping up
-- max_locks_per_transactions.
--

-- Show locks in master and in segments. Because the number of segments
-- in the cluster depends on configuration, we print only summary information
-- of the locks in segments. If a relation is locked only on one segment,
-- we print that as a special case, but otherwise we just print "n segments",
-- meaning the relation is locked on more than one segment.
