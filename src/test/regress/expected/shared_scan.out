-- We are very particular about this plan shape and data distribution with ORCA:
-- 1. `jazz` has to be the inner table of the outer HASH JOIN, so that on a
-- segment which has zero tuples in `jazz`, the Sequence node that contains the
-- Shared Scan will be squelched on that segment. If `jazz` is not on the inner
-- side, the above mentioned "hang" scenario will not be covered.
-- 2. The Shared Scan producer has to be on a different slice from consumers,
-- and some tuples coming out of the Share Scan producer on one segments are
-- redistributed to a different segment over Motion. If not, the above mentioned
-- "wrong result" scenario will not be covered.
