-- Tests exception handling of GPDB PL/PgSQL UDF
-- It exercises:
--  1. PROTOCOL or SQL type of dtm_action_target
--  2. Various levels of sub-transactions
--  3. dtm_action_protocol(PROTOCOL): subtransaction_begin, subtransaction_rollback or subtransaction_release
--  4. dtm_action: fail_begin_command, fail_end_command or panic_begin_comand
--
-- debug_dtm_action: Using this can specify what action to be
-- triggered/simulated and at what point like error / panic / delay
-- and at start or end command after receiving by the segment.
-- debug_dtm_action_segment: Using this can specify segment number to
-- trigger the specified dtm_action.
-- debug_dtm_action_target: Allows to set target for specified
-- dtm_action should it be DTM protocol command or SQL command from
-- master to segment.
-- debug_dtm_action_protocol: Allows to specify sub-type of DTM
-- protocol for which to perform specified dtm_action (like prepare,
-- abort_no_prepared, commit_prepared, abort_prepared,
-- subtransaction_begin, subtransaction_release,
-- subtransaction_rollback, etc...
--
-- debug_dtm_action_sql_command_tag: If debug_dtm_action_target is sql
-- then this parameter can be used to set the type of sql that should
-- trigger the exeception. Ex: 'MPPEXEC UPDATE'
-- debug_dtm_action_nestinglevel: This allows to optional specify at
-- which specific depth level in transaction to take the specified
-- dtm_action. This apples only to target with protocol and not SQL.
