-- In GPDB, the tuple is sent from the QE to QD via the interconnect, while
-- the NOTICE is sent via the main QE-QD libpq connection. It's not
-- deterministic, which one reaches the QD first. Add a little sleep here
-- to make it more consistent, for the sake of having stable expected output.
--
-- Even with the sleep, there's no guarantee. One known inconsistency at the
-- moment is that the UDP interconnect buffers tuples differently. So despite
-- the sleep, we need an alternative expected output file for the case that
-- all the NOTICEs arrive before the tuples, but at least we don't need an
-- output file for every combination of orderings of the NOTICEs and the
-- tuples, in the three COPY (...) TO STDOUT commands below. It may seem odd
-- that the BEFORE NOTICE arrives only after the tuple, despite this sleep,
-- but it's not well defined when the QD drains the NOTICes from the libpq
-- connection relative to the interconnect data.
