-- Test using an external table in a subquery.
--
-- We used to have a bug where the scan on the external table was not
-- broadcast to all nodes, so each segment scanned only its own portion
-- of the external table, when the scan was in a subquery. In that case,
-- the count(*) calculated for each value below was 1, but it should be
-- equal to the number of segments, because this external table produces
-- the same rows on every segment.
CREATE EXTERNAL WEB TABLE echotable (c1 int, c2 int, c3 int) EXECUTE
'echo "1,2,3"; echo "4,5,6";' FORMAT 'TEXT' (DELIMITER ',');
create table test_ext_foo (c1 int, c2 int4);
NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause -- Using column named 'c1' as the Greenplum Database data distribution key for this table.
HINT:  The 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause determines the distribution of data. Make sure column(s) chosen are the optimal data distribution key to minimize skew.
insert into test_ext_foo select g, g from generate_series(1, 20) g;
-- This should return 2 and 5, as the two rows are duplicated in
-- every segment (assuming you have at least two segments in your
-- cluster).
select c2 from echotable group by c2 having count(*) >= 2;
