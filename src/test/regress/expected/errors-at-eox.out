-- Test what happens, when an ERROR occurs at various stages of COMMIT
-- or ABORT processing. This test uses the fault injection mechanism
-- built in to the server, to induce an ERROR at strategic places.
--

-- Create a plain table that we can insert to, to verify after the
-- transaction whether the transaction's effects are visible.
CREATE TABLE dtm_testtab(id int4);
NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause -- Using column named 'id' as the Greenplum Database data distribution key for this table.
HINT:  The 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause determines the distribution of data. Make sure column(s) chosen are the optimal data distribution key to minimize skew.
-- throw an ERROR, just after we have broadcast the PREPARE of the
-- transaction to segments.
