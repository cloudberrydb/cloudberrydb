--         This test had an "order" directive, but it wasn't getting passed 
--         through to the output file (and there wasn't one in the .ans file), 
--         so it wasn't taking effect.  
--         Because the "order" directive specifies columns by
--         position, not name, it requires that the columns come out in a
--         known order, so I changed the "SELECT" clauses to specify the
--         columns individually rather than use "SELECT *".
