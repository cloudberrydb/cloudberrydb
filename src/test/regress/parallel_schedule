# 'inherit' test is disabled in GPDB. FIXME: why?
#test: inherit

# 'triggers' test is disabled in GPDB, because it contains a trigger function
# that would need to access rows on other segments, which doens't work. You
# get errors like:
# ERROR: function cannot execute on segment because it accesses relation "public.pkeys"
#test: triggers

# Depends on the above
test: create_index create_view

# sanity_check does a vacuum, affecting the sort order of SELECT *
# results. So it should not run parallel to other tests.

# Output of the 'combocid' test contains ctid and cmin values, which will

# 'foreign_key' test is disabled, because it contains several tables with
