# GPDB_91_MERGE_FIXME: GPDB acquires ExclusiveLock for update and delete SQL
# statements.  This invalidates most of the isolation tests from upstream below.
# E.g. an UPDATE step executed by isolationtester never returns because another
# session run in the same permutation holds ExclusiveLock that blocks the step.
# GPDB_94_MERGE_FIXME: Since the introduction of Global Deadlock Detector, an
# UPDATE/DELETE no longer acquires ExclusiveLock. So we could perhaps enable
# some of these now.
# GPDB_94_MERGE_FIXME: But SELECT FOR UPDATE still acquires a whole-table
# ExclusiveLock. Why?
