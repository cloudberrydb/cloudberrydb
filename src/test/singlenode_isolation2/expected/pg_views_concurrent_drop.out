-- visible to the second transaction, but deparsing the view's
-- definition will block until the first transaction ends. And if the
-- first transaction committed, the definition cannot be fetched.
-- It's returned as NULL in that case. (PostgreSQL throws an ERROR,
-- but getting a spurious ERROR when all you do is query pg_views is
-- not nice.)
