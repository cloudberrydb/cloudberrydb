-> tincrepo is the repository that will host all the test scripts that can be
   run atop tinc. E.g. all the SQL files, python test methods etc.
-> tinc.py should be able to run any tests off tincrepo
-> To make it easier for any user to find relevant tests for a bug fix or a
   changelist, tincrepo will impose a specific folder structure while
   checking-in tests to the repository.

NOTE: It is the test author's responsibility to not grow tincrepo/main
      vertically. Please use caution while adding tests for new features.

Following is the initial test classification that was decided upon for tincrepo:

benchmarks
catalog
cursors
data_mining
ddl
dispatch
dml
errors
functions
interconnect
languages
loading
mirroring
olap
partitioning
query
resource_management
security
storage
transactions
types
user_defined_objects
utilities
vacuum

While checking-in tests for a feature, the tests should belong to one of the
above mentioned categories making it easier for users to find tests to run
for a specific feature or a changelist. E.g. upgrade tests should belong to
utilities/upgrade etc.
