=====================
"PostgreSQL comes with additional extensions, libraries and tools that are referred to as contrib modules.
Extensions aren't installed in databases by default, but they can be installed on a per-database basis to provide additional functionality and features. In PostgreSQL 9.1 and later, these can be installed via the CREATE EXTENSION command. Older versions execute an SQL script in the database they are to be installed in.
Libraries add system-wide functionality rather than per database. These can be loaded into individual sessions, or configured to be preloaded into the server to be made automatically available to all sessions.
Tools are applications used outside of the database and provide various utility functions."
