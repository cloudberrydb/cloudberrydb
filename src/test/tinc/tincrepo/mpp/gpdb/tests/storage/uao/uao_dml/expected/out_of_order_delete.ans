-- MPP-23546: out of order tuples spanning more than one visimap
-- entry.  We have verified through gdb that the following delete
-- statement results in one visimap entry encountered more than once
-- in appendonly_delete_finish() code path.  This is because values 12
-- and 1001 of foo.a are covered by one visimap entry where as the
-- value 80001 is covered by a different visimap entry.  Assumption:
-- the values are inserted in increasing order by a single insert
-- transaction.
-- Ensure that tuples to be deleted are from the same GPDB segment.
-- This query should return the same output irrespective of GPDB
-- configuration (1 segdb, 2 or more segdbs).
