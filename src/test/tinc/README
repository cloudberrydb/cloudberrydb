================================================================================
TINC (a.k.a. "TINC Is Not Cdbfast") ============================================
================================================================================

	TINC is a new attempt at Greenplum's core testing infrastructure. From it's
name, it should be clear that TINC is designed with the pitfalls of its
predecessor in mind. The most important of these requirements is a philosophy
of rigid design at the core of the project. CDBFast lacked this quality, and
it's one that we'll strongly adhere to under TINC.

----------------------------------------
Guidelines to run the tests
----------------------------------------
* Source greenplum_path.sh before sourcing tinc_env.sh

* Run `make <test target>`
  E.g. make storage_uao_and_transactionmanagement
  You can find targets in the top level Makefile $TINCHOME/Makefile.

  -- OR --

  Run `python tinc.py discover <test/directory/path>`
  E.g. python tinc.py discover tincrepo/mpp/gpdb/tests/storage/basic/lock

  -- OR --

  Run `python tinc.py <test.path>`
  E.g. python tinc.py mpp.gpdb.tests.storage.basic.lock.test_locks

  Check `python tinc.py --help` for more details on running tests from tinc.py.

* Log files are created in a "log" directory which detail the steps executed as
  part of the test run. This is a helpful resource to utilize on test failure
  investigation.


----------------------------------------
Rules ----------------------------------
----------------------------------------

	Rule #1: Read PEP8! <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>

	Rule #2: See Rule #1.

The above usually covers most concerns. Here are a few extra ones we feel
strongly about:

* Always source greenplum_path.sh, then tinc_env.sh (in that order.)
* Use unittest asserts, rather than python's "assert" keyword, when possible.
  This will result in more descriptive output during AssertionErrors.
* Alphabetize imports. (It's reasonable to break this for grouping. As with
  all of these rules, readability is the key.)
* Add docstrings.
* No numbering in test case name.
