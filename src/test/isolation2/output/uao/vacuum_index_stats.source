-- This is intended to test a new behavior of VACUUM AO/CO enhancement.
-- The enhacement introduced a new strategy to improve performance by
-- vacuuming indexes based on the collected AWAITING_DROP segment files,
-- instead of reading AO/CO visibility map catalog for every index tuple.
-- This behavior would lead to the index->reltuples being updated only when
-- AWAITING_DROP segment is greater than 0, which requires compaction during
-- VACUUM. If no compaction happens, even if dead tuples were deleted,
-- index->reltuples wouldn't get updated accordingly, which could generate
-- difference between table->reltuples and index->reltuples. That is supposed
-- to be fine in most cases since bloating size of indexes is limited in
-- the scope of gp_appendonly_compaction_threshold percentage of total tuples.
-- The new strategy would not impact table->reltuples updates.
