-- restore the cluster. Previously there is a bug the incremental recovery
-- hangs in pg_rewind due to lock conflict. pg_rewinds runs a single-mode
-- postgres to ensure clean shutdown of the postgres. That will recover the
-- unhandled prepared transactions into memory which will hold locks. For
-- example, "create database" will hold the lock of template1 on pg_database
-- with mode 5, but that conflicts with the mode 3 lock which is needed during
-- postgres starting in InitPostgres() and thus pg_rewind hangs forever.
