-- Scenario 1: Test to fail broadcasting of COMMIT PREPARED to one
-- segment and hence trigger PANIC in master while after completing
-- phase 2 of 2PC. Master's recovery cycle should correctly broadcast
-- COMMIT PREPARED again because master should find distributed commit
-- record in its xlog during recovery. Verify that the transaction is
-- committed after recovery. This scenario used to create cluster
-- inconsistency due to bug fixed now, as transaction used to get
-- committed on all segments except one where COMMIT PREPARED
-- broadcast failed before recovery. Master used to miss sending the
-- COMMIT PREPARED across restart and instead abort the transaction
-- after querying in-doubt prepared transactions from segments.
