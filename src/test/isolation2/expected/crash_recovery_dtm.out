-- COMMIT PREPARED again because master should find distributed commit
-- record in its xlog during recovery. Verify that the transaction is

-- committed on all segments except one where COMMIT PREPARED
-- broadcast failed before recovery. Master used to miss sending the

-- after querying in-doubt prepared transactions from segments.
