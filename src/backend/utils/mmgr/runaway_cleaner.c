 * runaway_cleaner.c
 *	 Implementation of the runaway cleaner that checks if a session is marked
 *	 as runaway (i.e., consuming too much vmem) by the red-zone handler
 *	 (redzone_handler.c). The runaway cleaner cleans up such session by triggering
 *	 an elog(ERROR, ...) which rolls back transaction and releases memory. Once
 *	 cleanup is finished, the runaway cleaner also informs the red zone handler
 *	 so that a new runaway session can be chosen if necessary.
