/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * syncrep.c
 *
 * If requested, transaction commits wait until their commit LSN is
 * acknowledged by the sync standby.
 *
 * This module contains the code for waiting and release of backends.
 * All code in this module executes on the primary. The core streaming
 * replication transport remains within WALreceiver/WALsender modules.
 *
 * The essence of this design is that it isolates all logic about
 * waiting/releasing onto the primary. The primary looks for an active and
 * a sync-requesting standby and then based on that makes the backends wait
 * for completion of replication.
 *
 * Replication is either synchronous or not synchronous (async). If it is
 * async, we just fastpath out of here. If it is sync, then we wait for
 * the write or flush location on the standby before releasing the waiting backend.
 *
 * The best performing way to manage the waiting backends is to have a
 * single ordered queue of waiting backends, so that we can avoid
 * searching them through all waiters each time we receive a reply.
