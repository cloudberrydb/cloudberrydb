 *
 * syncrep.c
 *
 * Synchronous replication is new as of PostgreSQL 9.1.
 *
 * If requested, transaction commits wait until their commit LSN are
 * acknowledged by the synchronous standbys.
 *
 * This module contains the code for waiting and release of backends.
 * All code in this module executes on the primary. The core streaming
 * replication transport remains within WALreceiver/WALsender modules.
 *
 * The essence of this design is that it isolates all logic about
 * waiting/releasing onto the primary. The primary defines which standbys
 * it wishes to wait for. The standbys are completely unaware of the
 * durability requirements of transactions on the primary, reducing the
 * complexity of the code and streamlining both standby operations and
 * network bandwidth because there is no requirement to ship
 * per-transaction state information.
 *
 * Replication is either synchronous or not synchronous (async). If it is
 * async, we just fastpath out of here. If it is sync, then we wait for
 * the write, flush or apply location on the standby before releasing
 * the waiting backend. Further complexity in that interaction is
 * expected in later releases.
 *
 * The best performing way to manage the waiting backends is to have a
 * single ordered queue of waiting backends, so that we can avoid
 * searching the through all waiters each time we receive a reply.
 *
 * In 9.5 or before only a single standby could be considered as
 * synchronous. In 9.6 we support a priority-based multiple synchronous
 * standbys. In 10.0 a quorum-based multiple synchronous standbys is also
 * supported. The number of synchronous standbys that transactions
 * must wait for replies from is specified in synchronous_standby_names.
 * This parameter also specifies a list of standby names and the method
 * (FIRST and ANY) to choose synchronous standbys from the listed ones.
 *
 * The method FIRST specifies a priority-based synchronous replication
 * and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are
 * replicated to the requested number of synchronous standbys chosen based
 * on their priorities. The standbys whose names appear earlier in the list
 * are given higher priority and will be considered as synchronous.
 * Other standby servers appearing later in this list represent potential
 * synchronous standbys. If any of the current synchronous standbys
 * disconnects for whatever reason, it will be replaced immediately with
 * the next-highest-priority standby.
 *
 * The method ANY specifies a quorum-based synchronous replication
 * and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are
 * replicated to at least the requested number of synchronous standbys
 * in the list. All the standbys appearing in the list are considered as
 * candidates for quorum synchronous standbys.
 *
 * If neither FIRST nor ANY is specified, FIRST is used as the method.
 * This is for backward compatibility with 9.6 or before where only a
 * priority-based sync replication was supported.
 *
 * Before the standbys chosen from synchronous_standby_names can
 * become the synchronous standbys they must have caught up with
 * the primary; that may take some time. Once caught up,
 * the standbys which are considered as synchronous at that moment
 * will release waiters from the queue.
