/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * preptlist.c
 *	  Routines to preprocess the parse tree target list
 *
 * For an INSERT, the targetlist must contain an entry for each attribute of
 * the target relation in the correct order.
 *
 * For an UPDATE, the targetlist just contains the expressions for the new
 * column values.
 *
 * For UPDATE and DELETE queries, the targetlist must also contain "junk"
 * tlist entries needed to allow the executor to identify the rows to be
 * updated or deleted; for example, the ctid of a heap row.  (The planner
 * adds these; they're not in what we receive from the planner/rewriter.)
 *
 * For all query types, there can be additional junk tlist entries, such as
 * sort keys, Vars needed for a RETURNING list, and row ID information needed
 * for SELECT FOR UPDATE locking and/or EvalPlanQual checking.
 *
 * The query rewrite phase also does preprocessing of the targetlist (see
 * rewriteTargetListIU).  The division of labor between here and there is
 * partially historical, but it's not entirely arbitrary.  The stuff done
 * here is closely connected to physical access to tables, whereas the
 * rewriter's work is more concerned with SQL semantics.
