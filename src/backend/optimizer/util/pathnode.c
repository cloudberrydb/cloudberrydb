 * add_path
 *	  Consider a potential implementation path for the specified parent rel,
 *	  and add it to the rel's pathlist if it is worthy of consideration.
 *	  A path is worthy if it has a better sort order (better pathkeys) or
 *	  cheaper cost (on either dimension), or generates fewer rows, than any
 *	  existing path that has the same or superset parameterization rels.
 *
 *	  We also remove from the rel's pathlist any old paths that are dominated
 *	  by new_path --- that is, new_path is cheaper, at least as well ordered,
 *	  generates no more rows, and requires no outer rels not required by the
 *	  old path.
 *
 *	  In most cases, a path with a superset parameterization will generate
 *	  fewer rows (since it has more join clauses to apply), so that those two
 *	  figures of merit move in opposite directions; this means that a path of
 *	  one parameterization can seldom dominate a path of another.  But such
 *	  cases do arise, so we make the full set of checks anyway.
 *
 *	  There are two policy decisions embedded in this function, along with
 *	  its sibling add_path_precheck.  First, we treat all parameterized paths
 *	  as having NIL pathkeys, so that they cannot win comparisons on the
 *	  basis of sort order.  This is to reduce the number of parameterized
 *	  paths that are kept; see discussion in src/backend/optimizer/README.
 *
 *	  Second, we only consider cheap startup cost to be interesting if
 *	  parent_rel->consider_startup is true for an unparameterized path, or
 *	  parent_rel->consider_param_startup is true for a parameterized one.
 *	  Again, this allows discarding useless paths sooner.
 *
 *	  The pathlist is kept sorted by total_cost, with cheaper paths
 *	  at the front.  Within this routine, that's simply a speed hack:
 *	  doing it that way makes it more likely that we will reject an inferior
 *	  path after a few comparisons, rather than many comparisons.
 *	  However, add_path_precheck relies on this ordering to exit early
 *	  when possible.
 *
 *	  NOTE: discarded Path objects are immediately pfree'd to reduce planner
 *	  memory consumption.  We dare not try to free the substructure of a Path,
 *	  since much of it may be shared with other Paths or the query tree itself;
 *	  but just recycling discarded Path nodes is a very useful savings in
 *	  a large join tree.  We can recycle the List nodes of pathlist, too.
 *
 *	  NB: The Path that is passed to add_path() must be considered invalid
 *	  upon return, and not touched again by the caller, because we free it
 *	  if we already know of a better path.  Likewise, a Path that is passed
 *	  to add_path() must not be shared as a subpath of any other Path of the
 *	  same join level.
 *
 *	  BUT: we do not pfree IndexPath objects, since they may be referenced as
 *	  children of BitmapHeapPaths as well as being paths in their own right.
 *
 * 'parent_rel' is the relation entry to which the path corresponds.
 * 'new_path' is a potential path for parent_rel.
 *
 * Returns nothing, but modifies parent_rel->pathlist.

 * Create a UniquePath to deduplicate based on the ctid and gp_segment_id,

 *

 * normal inner join (that's JOIN_UNIQUE_OUTER and JOIN_UNIQUE_INNER). GPDB
 * has a third way to implement them: Perform an inner join first, and then
 * eliminate duplicates from the result. The JOIN_DEDUP_SEMI and
 * JOIN_DEDUP_SEMI_REVERSE join types indicate such plans.
 *
 * The JOIN_DEDUP_SEMI plan will look something like this:
 *
 * postgres=# explain select * from s where exists (select 1 from r where s.a = r.b);
 *                                                       QUERY PLAN                                                      
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Gather Motion 3:1  (slice3; segments: 3)  (cost=189.75..190.75 rows=100 width=18)
 *    ->  HashAggregate  (cost=189.75..190.75 rows=34 width=18)
 *          Group By: s.ctid::bigint, s.gp_segment_id
 *          ->  Result  (cost=11.75..189.25 rows=34 width=18)
 *                ->  Redistribute Motion 3:3  (slice2; segments: 3)  (cost=11.75..189.25 rows=34 width=18)
 *                      Hash Key: s.ctid
 *                      ->  Hash Join  (cost=11.75..187.25 rows=34 width=18)
 *                            Hash Cond: r.b = s.a
 *                            ->  Seq Scan on r  (cost=0.00..112.00 rows=3334 width=4)
 *                            ->  Hash  (cost=8.00..8.00 rows=100 width=18)
 *                                  ->  Broadcast Motion 3:3  (slice1; segments: 3)  (cost=0.00..8.00 rows=100 width=18)
 *                                        ->  Seq Scan on s  (cost=0.00..4.00 rows=34 width=18)
 *  Settings:  optimizer=off
 *  Optimizer status: legacy query optimizer
 * (14 rows)
 *
 *
 * In PostgreSQL, this is never better than doing a JOIN_SEMI directly.
 * But it can be a win in GPDB, if the distribution of the outer and inner
 * relations don't match, and the outer relation is much larger than the
 * inner relation. In the above example, a normal semi-join would have to
 * have 's' on the outer side, and 'r' on the inner side. A hash semi-join
 * can't be performed the other way 'round, because the duplicate
 * elimination in a semi-join is done when building the hash table.
 * Furthermore, you can't have a Broadcast motion on the outer side of
 * a semi-join, because that could also generate duplicates. That leaves
 * the planner no choice, but to redistribute the larger 'r' relation,
 * in a JOIN_SEMI plan.
 *
 * So in GPDB, we try to implement semi-joins as a inner joins, followed
 * by an explicit UniquePath to eliminate the duplicates. That allows the
 * above plan, where the smaller 's' relation is Broadcast to all the
 * segments, and the duplicates that can arise from doing that are eliminated
 * above the join. You get one more Motion than with a JOIN_SEMI plan, but
 * each Motion has to move much fewer rows.
 *
 * The role of this function is to insert the UniquePath to represent
 * the deduplication above the join. Returns a UniquePath node representing
 * a "DISTINCT ON r1,...,rn" operator, where (r1,...,rn) represents a unique
 * identifier for each row of the cross product of the tables specified by
 * the 'distinct_relids' parameter.
 *
 * NB: The returned node shares the given 'distinct_relids' bitmapset object;
 * so the caller must not free or modify it during the node's lifetime.
 *
 * If a row's duplicates might occur in more than one partition, a Motion
 * operator will be needed to bring them together.  Since this path might
 * not be chosen, we won't take the time to create a CdbMotionPath node here.
 * Just estimate what the cost would be, and assign a dummy locus; leave
 * the real work for create_plan().
