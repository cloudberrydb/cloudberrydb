 * Parameters gp_role
 *
 * The run-time parameters (GUC variables) gp_role
 * reports and provides control over the role assumed by a
 * postgres process.
 *
 * Valid  roles are the following:
 *
 *	dispatch	The process acts as a parallel SQL dispatcher.
 *	execute		The process acts as a parallel SQL executor.
 *	utility		The process acts as a simple SQL engine.
 *
 * For postmaster, the parameter is initialized by '-c' (required).
 *
 * For normal connections to cluster, you can connect to QD directly,
 * but can not connect to QE directly unless specifying the utility role.
 *
 * For utility role connection to either QD or QE, PGOPTIONS could be used.
 * Alternatively, libpq-based applications can be modified to set
 * the value directly via an argument to one of the libpq functions
 * PQconnectdb, PQsetdbLogin or PQconnectStart.
 *
 * For single backend connection, utility role is enforced in code.
