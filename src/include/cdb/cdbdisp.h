/*
 * cdbdisp_dispatchToGang:
 * Send the strCommand SQL statement to the subset of all segdbs in the cluster
 * specified by the gang parameter. cancelOnError indicates whether an error
 * occurring on one of the qExec segdbs should cause all still-executing commands to cancel
 * on other qExecs. Normally this would be true. The commands are sent over the libpq
 * connections that were established during cdblink_setup. They are run inside of threads.
 * The number of segdbs handled by any one thread is determined by the
 * guc variable gp_connections_per_thread.
 *
 * The caller must provide a CdbDispatchResults object having available
 * resultArray slots sufficient for the number of QEs to be dispatched:
 * i.e., resultCapacity - resultCount >= gp->size. This function will
 * assign one resultArray slot per QE of the Gang, paralleling the Gang's
 * db_descriptors array. Success or failure of each QE will be noted in
 * the QE's CdbDispatchResult entry; but before examining the results, the
 * caller must wait for execution to end by calling CdbCheckDispatchResult().
 *
 * The CdbDispatchResults object owns some malloc'ed storage, so the caller
 * must make certain to free it by calling cdbdisp_destroyDispatcherState().
 *
 * When dispatchResults->cancelOnError is false, strCommand is to be
 * dispatched to every connected gang member if possible, despite any
 * cancellation requests, QE errors, connection failures, etc.
 *
 * NB: This function should return normally even if there is an error.
 * It should not longjmp out via elog(ERROR, ...), ereport(ERROR, ...),
 * PG_THROW, CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS, etc.
