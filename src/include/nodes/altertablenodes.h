 *
 * State information for ALTER TABLE
 *
 * The pending-work queue for an ALTER TABLE is a List of AlteredTableInfo
 * structs, one for each table modified by the operation (the named table
 * plus any child tables that are affected).  We save lists of subcommands
 * to apply to this table (possibly modified by parse transformation steps);
 * these lists will be executed in Phase 2.  If a Phase 3 step is needed,
 * necessary information is stored in the constraints and newvals lists.
 *
 * Phase 2 is divided into multiple passes; subcommands are executed in
 * a pass determined by subcommand type.
