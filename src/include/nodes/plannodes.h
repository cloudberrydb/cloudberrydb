 *
 * indexqualorig is an implicitly-ANDed list of index qual expressions, each

 * The indexkey is a Var or expression referencing column(s) of the index's
 * base table.  The comparisonval might be any expression, but it won't use
 * any columns of the base table.  The expressions are ordered by index
 * column position (but items referencing the same index column can appear
 * in any order).  indexqualorig is used at runtime only if we have to recheck
 * a lossy indexqual.
 *
 * indexqual has the same form, but the expressions have been commuted if
 * necessary to put the indexkeys on the left, and the indexkeys are replaced
 * by Var nodes identifying the index columns (their varno is INDEX_VAR and
 * their varattno is the index column number).
 *
 * indexorderbyorig is similarly the original form of any ORDER BY expressions
 * that are being implemented by the index, while indexorderby is modified to
 * have index column Vars on the left-hand side.  Here, multiple expressions
 * must appear in exactly the ORDER BY order, and this is not necessarily the
 * index column order.  Only the expressions are provided, not the auxiliary
 * sort-order information from the ORDER BY SortGroupClauses; it's assumed
 * that the sort ordering is fully determinable from the top-level operators.
 * indexorderbyorig is unused at run time, but is needed for EXPLAIN.
 * (Note these fields are used for amcanorderbyop cases, not amcanorder cases.)

 * indexes (for other indexes it should be "don't care").

 * that might be done for these requests must happen during the initial row
 * fetch; there is no mechanism for going back to lock a row later (and thus
 * no need for EvalPlanQual machinery during updates of foreign tables).
 * This means that the semantics will be a bit different than for a local
 * table; in particular we are likely to lock more rows than would be locked
 * locally, since remote rows will be locked even if they then fail
 * locally-checked restriction or join quals.  However, the alternative of
 * doing a separate remote query to lock each selected row is extremely
 * unappealing, so let's do it like this for now.
 *
 * When doing UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE, we have to uniquely
 * identify all the source rows, not only those from the target relations, so
 * that we can perform EvalPlanQual rechecking at need.  For plain tables we
 * can just fetch the TID, much as for a target relation; this case is
 * represented by ROW_MARK_REFERENCE.  Otherwise (for example for VALUES or
 * FUNCTION scans) we have to copy the whole row value.  ROW_MARK_COPY is
 * pretty inefficient, since most of the time we'll never need the data; but
 * fortunately the case is not performance-critical in practice.  Note that
 * we use ROW_MARK_COPY for non-target foreign tables, even if the FDW has a
 * concept of rowid and so could theoretically support some form of
 * ROW_MARK_REFERENCE.  Although copying the whole row value is inefficient,
 * it's probably still faster than doing a second remote fetch, so it doesn't
 * seem worth the extra complexity to permit ROW_MARK_REFERENCE.

 * PlanRowMark -

 *
 * When doing UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE, we create a separate
 * PlanRowMark node for each non-target relation in the query.  Relations that
 * are not specified as FOR UPDATE/SHARE are marked ROW_MARK_REFERENCE (if
 * regular tables) or ROW_MARK_COPY (if not).
 *
 * Initially all PlanRowMarks have rti == prti and isParent == false.
 * When the planner discovers that a relation is the root of an inheritance
 * tree, it sets isParent true, and adds an additional PlanRowMark to the
 * list for each child relation (including the target rel itself in its role
 * as a child).  The child entries have rti == child rel's RT index and
 * prti == parent's RT index, and can therefore be recognized as children by
 * the fact that prti != rti.
 *
 * The planner also adds resjunk output columns to the plan that carry
 * information sufficient to identify the locked or fetched rows.  For
 * regular tables (markType != ROW_MARK_COPY), these columns are named
 *		tableoid%u			OID of table
 *		ctid%u				TID of row
 * The tableoid column is only present for an inheritance hierarchy.
 * When markType == ROW_MARK_COPY, there is instead a single column named
 *		wholerow%u			whole-row value of relation
 * In all three cases, %u represents the rowmark ID number (rowmarkId).
 * This number is unique within a plan tree, except that child relation
 * entries copy their parent's rowmarkId.  (Assigning unique numbers
 * means we needn't renumber rowmarkIds when flattening subqueries, which
 * would require finding and renaming the resjunk columns as well.)
 * Note this means that all tables in an inheritance hierarchy share the
 * same resjunk column names.  However, in an inherited UPDATE/DELETE the
 * columns could have different physical column numbers in each subplan.
