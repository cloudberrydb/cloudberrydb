Notes about Visual Studio Express
---------------------------------
To build PostgreSQL using Visual Studio Express, the Microsoft Windows SDK
has to be installed. Since this is not included in the product
originally, extra steps are needed to make it work.

First, download and install a supported version of the Microsoft Windows SDK
from www.microsoft.com (v6.0 or greater).

Locate the files vcprojectengine.dll.express.config and
vcprojectengine.dll.config in the vc\vcpackages directory of
the Visual C++ Express installation. In these files, add the paths
to the Platform SDK to the Include, Library and Path tags. Be sure
to add them to the beginning of the list.

This should work for both GUI and commandline builds, but a restart
may be necessary.

Build Notes  (From the PostgreSQL 9.0 Manual)
-----------

Building with Visual C++ or the Platform SDK

PostgreSQL can be built using the Visual C++ compiler suite from Microsoft. 
These compilers can be either from Visual Studio, Visual Studio Express or recent versions of the Platform SDK. 
If you do not already have a Visual Studio environment set up, the easiest way us to use the compilers in the Platform SDK, which is a free download from Microsoft. 

PostgreSQL supports the compilers from Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008. 
When using the Platform SDK only, or when building for 64-bit Windows, only Visual Studio 2008 is supported. 

The tools for building using Visual C++, are in the src/tools/msvc directory.
When building, make sure that if there are tools from MinGW or Cygwin present in your system PATH, they are at the end of the path, after all Visual Studio paths. 
Also, make sure you have all the required Visual C++ tools available in the PATH. 
In Visual Studio, start the Visual Studio Command Prompt. 
In the Platform SDK, start the CMD shell listed under the SDK on the Start Menu. 
If you wish to build a 64-bit version, you must use the 64-bit version of the command, and vice versa. 
All commands should be run from the src\tools\msvc directory. 

Before you build, you may need to edit the file config.pl to reflect any configuration options you want to change, or the paths to any third party libraries to use. 
The complete configuration is determined by first reading and parsing the file config_default.pl, and then apply any changes from config.pl. 
For example, to specify the location of your Python installation, put the following in config.pl: 

   $config->{python} = 'c:\python26';

  You only need to specify those parameters that are different from what's in config_default.pl. 

If you need to set any other environment variables, create a file called buildenv.pl and put the required commands there. 
For example, to add the path for bison when it's not in the PATH, create a file containing: 

   $ENV{PATH}=$ENV{PATH} . ';c:\some\where\bison\bin';

  
16.1.1. Requirements

PostgreSQL will build using either the professional versions (any edition) or the free Express edition of Visual Studio 2005 or 2008. 

The following additional products are required to build the complete package. 
Use the config.pl file to specify which directories the libraries are available in. 

Microsoft Platform SDK

It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest available version of the Microsoft Platform SDK, available for download from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/. 

You must always include the Windows Headers and Libraries part of the SDK. 
If you install the Platform SDK including the Visual C++ Compilers, you don't need Visual Studio to build. 


ActiveState Perl

ActiveState Perl is required to run the build generation scripts. 
MinGW or Cygwin Perl will not work. 
It must also be present in the PATH. 
Binaries can be downloaded from http://www.activestate.com (Note: version 5.8 is required, the free Standard Distribution is sufficient). 

ActiveState TCL

Required for building PL/TCL (Note: version 8.4 is required, the free Standard Distribution is sufficient). 

Bison and Flex

Bison and Flex are required to build from CVS, but not required when building from a release file. 
Note that only Bison 1.875 or versions 2.2 and later will work. 
Bison and Flex can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net. 
(You can use cygwin's bison and flex, if cygwin is the LAST thing in the PATH, after all Visual Studio and SDK items)

Diff

Diff is required to run the regression tests, and can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net. 

Gettext

Gettext is required to build with NLS support, and can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net. 
Note that binaries, dependencies and developer files are all needed. 

Microsoft Platform SDK

It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest available version of the Microsoft Platform SDK, available for download from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/. 

MIT Kerberos

Required for Kerberos authentication support.
MIT Kerberos can be downloaded from http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/dist/index.html. 

libxml2 and libxslt  

Required for XML support.  (Not needed for GPDB)
Binaries can be downloaded from http://zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml or source from http://xmlsoft.org. Note that libxml2 requires iconv, which is available from the same download location. 

openssl

Required for SSL support. 
Binaries can be downloaded from http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html or source from http://www.openssl.org. 

ossp-uuid

Required for UUID-OSSP support (contrib only). (Not needed for GPDB)
Source can be downloaded from http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/. 

Python

Required for building PL/Python. 
Binaries can be downloaded from http://www.python.org. 

zlib

Required for compression support in pg_dump and pg_restore. Always required for GPDB.
Binaries can be downloaded from http://www.zlib.net. 


16.1.2. Building

To build all of PostgreSQL in release configuration (the default), run the command: 

         build
    
   To build all of PostgreSQL in debug configuration, run the command: 

         build DEBUG
    
   To build just a single project, for example psql, run the commands: 

         build psql
    
         build DEBUG psql
    
   To change the default build configuration to debug, put the following in the buildenv.pl file: 

         $ENV{CONFIG}="Debug";
    
   
It is also possible to build from inside the Visual Studio GUI. In this case, you need to run: 

         perl mkvcbuild.pl
    
   from the command prompt, and then open the generated pgsql.sln (in the root directory of the source tree) in Visual Studio. 

16.1.3. Cleaning and installing

Most of the time, the automatic dependency tracking in Visual Studio will handle changed files. 
But if there have been large changes, you may need to clean the installation. 
To do this, simply run the clean.bat command, which will automatically clean out all generated files. 
You can also run it with the dist parameter, in which case it will behave like make distclean and remove the flex/bison output files as well. 

By default, all files are written into a subdirectory of the debug or release directories. To install these files using the standard layout, and also generate the files required to initialize and use the database, run the command: 

         perl install.pl c:\destination\directory
    
   
16.1.4. Running the regression tests

To run the regression tests, make sure you have completed the build of all required parts first. 
Also, make sure that the DLLs required to load all parts of the system (such as the Perl and Python DLLs for the procedural languages) are present in the system path. 
If they are not, set it through the buildenv.pl file. 
To run the tests, run one of the following commands from the src\tools\msvc directory: 

         vcregress check
    
         vcregress installcheck
    
         vcregress plcheck
    
         vcregress contribcheck
    
   To change the schedule used (default is the parallel), append it to the command line like: 

         vcregress check serial
=======
If you are using a recent version of the Microsoft Windows SDK that includes
the compilers and build tools you probably don't even need Visual Studio
Express to build PostgreSQL.


Structure of the build tools
----------------------------
The tools for building PostgreSQL using Microsoft Visual Studio currently
consist of the following files:

- Configuration files -
config_default.pl      default configuration arguments

A typical build environment has two more files, buildenv.pl and config.pl
that contain the user's build environment settings and configuration
arguments.


- User tools -
build.pl               tool to build the binaries
builddoc.pl            tool to build the docs
clean.bat              batch file for cleaning up generated files
install.pl             tool to install the generated files
mkvcbuild.pl           tool to generate the Visual Studio build files
vcregress.pl           tool to run the regression tests


- Internal tools -
gendef.pl              internal tool to generate .DEF files
pgbison.pl             internal tool to process .y files using bison
pgflex.pl              internal tool to process .l files using flex

Many of those .pl files also have a corresponding .bat-wrapper that doesn't
contain any additional logic.


- Internal modules -
Install.pm             module containing the install logic
Mkvcbuild.pm           module containing the code to generate the Visual
                       Studio build (project/solution) files
MSBuildProject.pm      module containing the code to generate MSBuild based
                       project files (Visual Studio 2010 or greater)
Project.pm             module containing the common code to generate the
                       Visual Studio project files. Also provides the
                       common interface of all project file generators
Solution.pm            module containing the code to generate the Visual
                       Studio solution files.
VCBuildProject.pm      module containing the code to generate VCBuild based
                       project files (Visual Studio 2005/2008)
VSObjectFactory.pm     factory module providing the code to create the
                       appropriate project/solution files for the current
                       environment


Description of the internals of the Visual Studio build process
---------------------------------------------------------------
By typing 'build' the user starts the build.bat wrapper which simply passes
it's arguments to build.pl.
In build.pl the user's buildenv.pl is used to set up the build environment
(i. e. path to bison and flex). In addition his config.pl file is merged into
config_default.pl to create the configuration arguments.
These configuration arguments are passed over to Mkvcbuild::mkvcbuild
(Mkvcbuild.pm) which creates the Visual Studio project and solution files.
It does this by using VSObjectFactory::CreateSolution to create an object
implementing the Solution interface (this could be either a VS2005Solution,
a VS2008Solution or a VS2010Solution, all in Solution.pm, depending on the
user's build environment) and adding objects implementing the corresponding
Project interface (VC2005Project or VC2008Project from VCBuildProject.pm or
VC2010Project from MSBuildProject.pm) to it.
When Solution::Save is called, the implementations of Solution and Project
save their content in the appropriate format.
The final step of starting the appropriate build program (msbuild or vcbuild)
is performed in build.pl again.
