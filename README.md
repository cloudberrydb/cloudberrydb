## Introduction

Apache Cloudberry (Incubating), created by the original developers of
Greenplum Database, is one advanced and mature open-source Massively Parallel
Processing (MPP) database, which evolves from the open-source version of the
Pivotal Greenplum Database®️ but features a newer PostgreSQL kernel and more
advanced enterprise capabilities. It can serve as a data warehouse and can
also be used for large-scale analytics and AI/ML workloads.

## Build and try out

### Build from source

You can follow [these guides](https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/deployment/) to build Cloudberry on
Linux OS (including RHEL/Rocky Linux, and Ubuntu) and macOS.

### Try out quickly

Welcome to try out Cloudberry via building [one Docker-based
Sandbox](./devops/sandbox), which is tailored to help you gain a basic
understanding of Cloudberry's capabilities and features.

## Repositories

This is the main repository for Apache Cloudberry (Incubating). Alongside
this, there are several ecosystem repositories for Cloudberry, including the
website, extensions, connectors, adapters, and other utilities.

* [apache/cloudberry-site](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry-site): website and documentation sources.
* [apache/cloudberry-backup](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry-backup): backup utility for Cloudberry.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Greenplum
Database](https://greenplum.org/) and other great open source projects to make
Apache Cloudberry has a sound foundation.

## License

Cloudberry is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. For details, see
the [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

## Export control

This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you
currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or
re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any
encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and
policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of
encryption software, to see if this is permitted. See
<https://www.wassenaar.org/> for more information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security
(BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN)
5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing
cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of
this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export
under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU)
exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for
both object code and source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

- Apache Cloudberry uses OpenSSL for TLS support on client and server
  connections, and for the SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication method.
- Apache Cloudberry optionally uses GSSAPI (Kerberos) for authentication and
  connection encryption, and LDAP over TLS for authentication.
- The bundled `pgcrypto` extension provides cryptographic functions to SQL,
  using either OpenSSL or its own built-in implementations.

Apache Cloudberry does not ship OpenSSL itself; it links against the OpenSSL
provided by the operating system.

## ASF Incubator disclaimer

Apache Cloudberry is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required
for all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
ASF.
