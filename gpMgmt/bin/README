=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- PYTHON =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

For Developers
==============

If you'd like to run the python scripts directly from this 
directory you will need to modify your PYTHONPATH variable to add the "ext" 
directory.  so something like:

	export PYTHONPATH=~/dev/cdb2/gpMgmt/bin/ext

should do the trick.


Python Version
--------------

* The current utilities bundle python 2.5.1.  We are planning on moving 
  forward to 2.6.1 in the near future.


Where Things Go
---------------

* If you are adding a GP module, please add it to the gppylib dir.
* If you are adding a 3rd party module, please add it to the ext dir.

Overview of gppylib
-------------------

dattimeutils.py  -  Several utility functions for dealing with date/time data

gparray.py
   |
   +-  Segment      - Configuration information for a single dbid
   |
   +-  SegmentPair - Configuration information for a single content id
   |     \-  Contains multiple Segment objects
   |
   +-  GpArray   - Configuration information for a Greenplum Database
         \-  Contains multiple SegmentPair objects

gphostcache.py   
  |
  +- GpHost      - Information about a single Host
  |    \- Contains all the Segment objects on the host
  |
  +- GpHostCache - Helps resolve interface->hostname lookups
       \- Contains all the GpHosts referenced in a Greenplum Database

gplog.py         - Utility functions to assist in Greenplum standard logging

gpparseopts.py   - Wrapper around optparse library to aid in locating help files

gpsubprocess.py  - Wrapper around python subprocess (?) 
   \- Used by commands/base.py   
    - Should move to the commands submodule? 

logfilter.py     - Contains numerous odd utility functions mostly not specific to logfilter

pgconf.py        - Contains helper functions for reading postgresql.conf files
  |
  +- gucdict      - dictionary of guc->value pairs

  |
  +- ConfigurationError - subclass of EnvironmentError, raised by type coercion functions

segcopy.py        - code for copying a segment from one location to another
    \- should be subclass of command ???

userinput.py      - wrapper functions around raw_input

commands/clsInjectFault - binary for filerep fault injection
        \- doesn't belong as a part of commands submodule

commands/gp.py     - Implements lots of subclasses of Command for various tasks
commands/pg.py     - Like gp.py, not clear what the separation is, if any.

  |
  +- Should have a wrapper class around a pygresql connection object!

util/gp_utils.py     - Greenplum related utility functions that are not Commands
util/ssh_session.py  - SSH and SCP related utility functions brought in from gpmlib.py/gplib.py
                       that are used by gpssh, gpscp and gpssh-exkeys


Testing Management Scripts
--------------------------

This directory contains the unit tests for the management scripts. These tests
require the following Python modules to be installed: mock and pygresql.
These modules can be installed by running "git submodule update --init --recursive"
if they are not already installed on your machine.

If you installed the dependencies using the above git command, you can run the tests with
make, using the following commands in the current directory:

"make check" will run all of the unit tests, some of which require a GPDB cluster to
be installed and currently running.

"make unitdevel" will run only the unit tests that do not require a running cluster.


If you did not install the dependencies using the git submodule, use the following commands in
place of the above make commands, still in the current directory:

"python -m unittest discover --verbose -s gppylib -p 'test_unit*.py' -p 'test_cluster*.py'" will
run all of the unit tests.

"python -m unittest discover --verbose -s gppylib -p 'test_unit*.py'" will run only the unit
tests that do not require a running cluster.
