*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpdbrestore utility recreates the data definitions (schema) and user 
data in a Greenplum database using the script files created by 
gpcrondump operations. 

When you restore from an incremental backup, the gpdbrestore utility 
assumes the complete backup set is available. The complete backup set 
includes the following backup files: 

* The last full backup before the specified incremental backup 

* All incremental backups created between the time of the full backup 
  the specified incremental backup 

The gpdbrestore utility provides the following functionality: 

* Automatically reconfigures for compression. 

* Validates the number of dump files are correct (For primary only, 
  mirror only, primary and mirror, or a subset consisting of some mirror 
  and primary segment dump files). 

* If a failed segment is detected, restores to active segment instances. 

* Except when restoring data from a NetBackup server, you do not need to 
  know the complete timestamp key (-t) of the backup set to restore. 
  Additional options are provided to instead give just a date (-b), backup 
  set directory location (-R), or database name (-s) to restore. 

* The -R option allows the ability to restore from a backup set located 
  on a host outside of the Greenplum Database array (archive host). 
  Ensures that the correct dump file goes to the correct segment instance. 

* Identifies the database name automatically from the backup set. 

* Allows you to restore particular tables only (-T option) instead of 
  the entire database. Note that single tables are not automatically 
  dropped or truncated prior to restore. 
  
  Performs an ANALYZE operation on the tables that are restored. You can 
  disable the ANALYZE operation by specifying the option --noanalyze. 

  
* Can restore global objects such as roles and tablespaces (-G option). 

* Detects if the backup set is primary segments only or primary and 
  mirror segments and passes the appropriate options to gp_restore. 

* Allows you to drop the target database before a restore in a single 
 operation. 


*****************************************************
Restoring a Database from NetBackup
*****************************************************

Greenplum Database must be configured to communicate with the Symantec 
NetBackup master server that is used to restore database data. See 
"Backing Up and Restoring Databases" in the "Greenplum Database 
Administrator Guide" for information about configuring Greenplum 
Database and NetBackup. 

When restoring from NetBackup server, you must specify the timestamp of 
the backup with the -t option. 

NetBackup is not compatible with DDBoost. Both NetBackup and DDBoost 
cannot be used in a single back up operation. 


*****************************************************
Restoring a Database with Named Pipes 
*****************************************************

If you used named pipes when you backed up a database with gpcrondump, 
named pipes with the backup data must be available when restoring the 
database from the backup. 


*****************************************************
Error Reporting 
*****************************************************

gpdbrestore does not report errors automatically. After the restore is 
completed, check the report status files to verify that there are no 
errors. The restore status files are stored in the db_dumps/<date>/ 
directory by default. 


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************
-a (do not prompt) 

 Do not prompt the user for confirmation. 

 
-b <YYYYMMDD> 

 Looks for dump files in the segment data directories on the Greenplum 
 Database array of hosts in db_dumps/<YYYYMMDD>. If --ddboost is specified, 
 the systems looks for dump files on the Data Domain Boost host. 

 
-B <parallel_processes>

 The number of segments to check in parallel for pre/post-restore 
 validation. If not specified, the utility will start up to 60 parallel 
 processes depending on how many segment instances it needs to restore. 


--change-schema=schema-name

 Optional. Restores tables from a backup created with gpcrondump to a
 different schema. The specified schema must exist in the database.
 If the schema does not exist, the utility returns an error. System
 catalog schemas are not supported.

 You must specify tables to restore with the -T and --table-file options.
 If a table that is being restored exists in schema-name, the utility
 returns a warning and attempts to append the data to the table from the
 backup. You can specify the --trunctate option to truncate table data
 before restoring data to the table from the backup.

 
-d <master_data_directory>

 Optional. The master host data directory. If not specified, the value 
 set for $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY will be used. 
 

--ddboost 

 Use Data Domain Boost for this restore, if the --ddboost option was 
 passed when the data was dumped. Before using Data Domain Boost, make 
 sure the one-time Data Domain Boost credential setup is complete. See 
 the Greenplum Database System Administrator Guide for details. 

 If you backed up Greenplum Database configuration files with the 
 gpcrondump option -g and specified the --ddboost option, you must 
 manually restore the backup from the Data Domain system. The 
 configuration files must be restored for the Greenplum Database master 
 and all the hosts and segments. The backup location on the Data Domain 
 system is the directory GPDB/<backup_directory>/<date>. The 
 <backup_directory> is set when you specify the Data Domain credentials 
 with gpcrondump. 

 --ddboost-storage-unit is optional, which provides a dynamic storage
 unit to get dump files from, backup directory defaults to the cluster's
 config file when the Data Domain Boost credentials were set. If this 
 option is not specified, it also defaults to the cluster's config file.

 This option is not supported if --netbackup-service-host is specified. 


-e (drop target database before restore) 

 Drops the target database before doing the restore and then recreates 
 it. 


-G [include|only]

 Restores global objects such as roles and tablespaces if the global 
 object dump file db_dumps/<date>/gp_global_1_1_<timestamp> is found in 
 the master data directory.

 Specify either "-G only" to only restore the global objects dump file
 or "-G include" to restore global objects along with a normal restore.
 Defaults to "include" if neither argument is provided.


-l <logfile_directory>

 The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs. 


--list-backup 

 Lists the set of full and incremental backup sets required to perform a 
 restore based on the <timestamp_key> specified with the -t option and the 
 location of the backup set. 

 This option is supported only if the <timestamp_key> is for an incremental
 backup.


-L (list tablenames in backup set) 

 When used with the -t option, lists the table names that exist in the 
 named backup set and exits. Does not perform a restore. 


-m (restore metadata only)

 Performs a restore of database metadata (schema and table definitions, SET
 statements, and so forth) without restoring data.  If the --restore-stats or
 -G options are provided as well, statistics or globals will also be restored.

 The --noplan and --noanalyze options are not supported in conjunction with
 this option, as they affect the restoration of data and no data is restored.


--netbackup-block-size <size>

 Specify the block size, in bytes, of data being transferred from the 
 Symantec NetBackup server. The default is 512 bytes. 

 NetBackup options are not supported if DDBoost backup options are 
 specified. 

 
--netbackup-service-host <netbackup_server> 

 The NetBackup master server that Greenplum Database connects to when 
 backing up to NetBackup. If you specify this option, you must specify 
 the timestamp of the backup with the -t option. 

 This option is not supported with any of the these options:
 -R, -s, -b, -L, or --ddboost.


--noanalyze

 The ANALYZE command is not run after a successful restore. The default 
 is to run the ANALYZE command on restored tables. This option is useful 
 if running ANALYZE on the tables requires a significant amount of time. 

 If this option is specified, you should run ANALYZE manually on 
 restored tables. Failure to run ANALYZE following a restore might result 
 in poor database performance. 


--noplan 

 Restores only the data backed up during the incremental backup specified 
 by the timestamp_key. No other data from the complete backup set are 
 restored. The full backup set containing the incremental backup must be 
 available. 

 If the timestamp_key specified with the -t option does not reference an 
 incremental backup, an error is returned. 


--prefix <prefix_string> 

 If you specified the gpcrondump option --prefix <prefix_string> to create 
 the backup, you must specify this option with the <prefix_string> when 
 restoring the backup. 

 If you created a full backup of a set of tables with gpcrondump and 
 specified a prefix, you can use gpcrondump with the options 
 --list-filter-tables and --prefix <prefix_string> to list the tables
 that were included or excluded for the backup. 


-q (no screen output) 

 Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on the screen, but is 
 still written to the log file. 


-R <hostname>:<path_to_dumpset>

 Allows you to provide a hostname and full path to a set of dump files. 
 The host does not have to be in the Greenplum Database array of hosts, 
 but must be accessible from the Greenplum master. 

 
--redirect <database_name>

 The name of the database where the data is restored. Specify this option 
 to restore data to a database that is different than the database 
 specified during back up. If <database_name> does not exist, it is 
 created. 

 
--report-status-dir <report_directory>

 Specifies the absolute path to the directory on the each Greenplum 
 Database host (master and segment hosts) where gpdbrestore writes report 
 status files for a restore operation. If <report_directory> does not exist 
 or is not writable, gpdbrestore returns an error and stops. 

 If this option is not specified and the -u option is specified, report 
 status files are written to the location specified by the -u option if 
 the -u location is writable. If the location specified by -u option is 
 not writable, the report status files are written to segment data 
 directories. 


--restore-stats [include|only]

 Restores optimizer statistics if the statistics dump file
 db_dumps/<date>/gp_statistics_1_1_<timestamp> is found in the master data
 directory. Setting this option automatically skips the final analyze step,
 so it is not necessary to also set the --noanalyze flag in conjunction with
 this one.

 Specify "--restore-stats only" to only restore the statistics dump file or
 "--restore-stats include" to restore statistics along with a normal restore.
 Defaults to "include" if neither argument is provided.
 
 If "--restore-stats only" is specified along with the -e option, an error
 is returned.


-s <database_name>

 Looks for latest set of dump files for the given database name in the 
 segment data directories db_dumps directory on the Greenplum Database 
 array of hosts. 


-t <timestamp_key>

 The 14 digit timestamp key that uniquely identifies a backup set of data 
 to restore. It is of the form YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. Looks for dump files 
 matching this timestamp key in the segment data directories db_dumps 
 directory on the Greenplum Database array of hosts. 


-T <schema>.<table_name>

 Table names to restore, specify multiple times for multiple tables. The 
 named table(s) must exist in the backup set of the database being restored. 
 Existing tables are not automatically truncated before data is restored 
 from backup. If your intention is to replace existing data in the table 
 from backup, truncate the table prior to running gpdbrestore -T. 


-S <schema>

 Schema names to restore, specify multiple times for multiple schemas. 
 Existing tables are not automatically truncated before data is restored 
 from backup. To replace the data in the schema tables with the data from
 backup, you can specify the --truncate option. The schema tables are 
 truncated.


--table-file <file_name> 

 Specify a file <file_name> that contains a list of table names to restore. 
 The file contains any number of table names, listed one per line. See 
 the -T option for information about restoring specific tables. 


--truncate

 Truncate table data before restoring data to the table from the backup.
 If this option is not specified, existing table data is not removed 
 before data is restored to the table. This option is supported only 
 when restoring a set of tables with the option -S, -T, or --table-file. 
 This option is not supported with the -e option.


-u <backup_directory> 

 Specifies the absolute path to the directory containing the db_dumps 
 directory on each host. If not specified, defaults to the data directory 
 of each instance to be backed up. Specify this option if you specified a 
 backup directory with the gpcrondump option -u when creating a backup 
 set. 
  
 If <backup_directory> is not writable, backup operation report status 
 files are written to segment data directories. You can specify a 
 different location where report status files are written with the 
 --report-status-dir option. 
 
 NOTE: This option is not supported if --ddboost is specified. 


-v | --verbose 

 Specifies verbose mode. 


--version (show utility version) 

 Displays the version of this utility. 


-? (help) 

 Displays the online help. 


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Restore the sales database from the latest backup files generated by 
gpcrondump (assumes backup files are in the segment data directories in 
db_dumps): 

  gpdbrestore -s sales 


Restore a database from backup files that reside on an archive host 
outside the Greenplum Database array (command issued on the Greenplum 
master host): 

  gpdbrestore -R archivehostname:/data_p1/db_dumps/20080214


Restore global objects only (roles and tablespaces): 

gpdbrestore -G 


NOTE: The -R option is not supported when restoring a backup set 
that includes incremental backups. 

If you restore from a backup set that contains an incremental backup, all the files in 
the backup set must be available to gpdbrestore. For example, the following 
timestamp keys specify a backup set. 20120514054532 is the full backup and the 
others are incremental.

  20120514054532
  20120714095512
  20120914081205
  20121114064330
  20130114051246

The following gbdbrestore command specifies the timestamp key 20121114064330. 
The incremental backup with the timestamps 20120714095512 and 20120914081205 
and the full backup must be available to perform a restore.

  gpdbrestore -t 20121114064330


The following gbdbrestore command uses the --noplan option to restore only the 
data that was backed up during the incremental backup with the timestamp key 
20121114064330. Data in the previous incremental backups and the data in the full 
backup are not restored.

  gpdbrestore -t 20121114064330 --noplan


This gpdbrestore command restores Greenplum Database data from the data 
managed by NetBackup master server nbu_server1. The option -t 
20130530090000 specifies the timestamp generated by gpcrondump when the 
backup was created. The -e option specifies that the target database is 
dropped before it is restored. 

  gpdbrestore -t 20130530090000 -e  --netbackup-service-host=nbu_server1
