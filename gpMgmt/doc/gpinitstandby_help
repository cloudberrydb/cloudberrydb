COMMAND NAME: gpinitstandby

Adds and/or initializes a standby coordinator host for a Greenplum Database system.


*****************************************************
SYNOPSIS
*****************************************************

gpinitstandby { -s <standby_hostname> [-P <port>] | -r | -n } 

[-a] [-q] [-D] [-S <standby data directory>] [-l <logfile_directory>]

gpinitstandby -? | -v


*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpinitstandby utility adds a backup, standby coordinator host to your 
Greenplum Database system. If your system has an existing standby coordinator 
host configured, use the -r option to remove it before adding the new 
standby coordinator host. 

Before running this utility, make sure that the Greenplum Database 
software is installed on the standby coordinator host and that you have 
exchanged SSH keys between the hosts. It is recommended that the coordinator 
port is set to the same port number on the coordinator host and the backup 
coordinator host. 

See the Greenplum Database Installation Guide for instructions. This 
utility should be run on the currently active primary coordinator host. 

The utility performs the following steps: 

* Updates the Greenplum Database system catalog to remove the existing 
  standby coordinator host information (if the -r option is supplied) 

* Updates the Greenplum Database system catalog to add the new standby 
  coordinator host information 

* Edits the pg_hba.conf file of the Greenplum Database coordinator to allow 
  access from the newly added standby coordinator. 

* Sets up the standby coordinator instance on the alternate coordinator host 

* Starts the synchronization process 

A backup, standby coordinator host serves as a 'warm standby' in the 
event of the primary coordinator host becoming non-operational. The standby 
coordinator is kept up to date by transaction log replication processes (the 
walsender and walreceiver), which run on the primary coordinator and standby 
coordinator hosts and keep the data between the primary and standby coordinator 
hosts synchronized. If the primary coordinator fails, the log replication 
process is shut down, and the standby coordinator can be activated in its 
place by using the gpactivatestandby utility. Upon activation of the 
standby coordinator, the replicated logs are used to reconstruct the state of 
the coordinator host at the time of the last successfully committed 
transaction. 

The activated standby coordinator effectively becomes the Greenplum Database 
coordinator, accepting client connections on the coordinator port and performing 
normal coordinator operations such as SQL command processing and workload 
management. 


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-a

 Do not prompt the user for confirmation. 


-D

 Sets logging level to debug. 


-l <logfile_directory> 

 The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs. 


-n

 Specify this option to start a Greenplum Database standby coordinator that 
 has been configured but has stopped for some reason. 


-P <port> 

 This option specifies the port that is used by the Greenplum Database 
 standby coordinator. The default is the same port used by the active 
 Greenplum Database coordinator. 

 If the Greenplum Database standby coordinator is on the same host as the 
 active coordinator, the ports must be different. If the ports are the same 
 for the active and standby coordinator and the host is the same, the utility 
 returns an error. (See also -S.)


-S <standby data directory>

 The data directory to use for a new standby coordinator. The default is the same
 directory used by the active coordinator.

 If the standby coordinator is on the same host as the active coordinator, a different
 directory must be provided using this option. (See also -P.)


-q

 Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on the screen, but is 
 still written to the log file. 


-r

 Removes the currently configured standby coordinator host from your Greenplum 
 Database system. 


-s <standby_hostname> 

 The host name of the standby coordinator host. 

--hba-hostnames

 Optional. use hostnames instead of CIDR in pg_hba.conf

-v

 Displays the version, status, last updated date, and check sum of this 
 utility. 


-?

 Displays the online help. 


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Add a standby coordinator host to your Greenplum Database system and start 
the synchronization process: 

gpinitstandby -s host09 

Start an existing standby coordinator host and synchronize the data with the 
current primary coordinator host: 

gpinitstandby -n 

NOTE: Do not specify the -n and -s options in the same command. 


Add a standby coordinator host to your Greenplum Database system specifying a 
different port: 

gpinitstandby -s myhost -P 2222 

If you specify the same host name as the active Greenplum Database 
coordinator, the installed Greenplum Database software that is used as a 
standby coordinator must be in a separate location from the active Greenplum 
Database coordinator.


Remove the existing standby coordinator from your Greenplum system 
configuration: 

gpinitstandby -r
