Feature: gpconfig integration tests

    # Below, we use 2 change (-c) operations to prove that we have changed a
    # file, because any existing postgresql.conf file could already have the
    # first value in it a priori
    #
    # NOTE: since we are SIGHUPing the database after each change (full restarts
    # would be too slow), you must choose parameters with a sighup or weaker
    # context.

    Scenario Outline: running gpconfig test case: <test_case>, for guc type: <type>
      Given the user runs "gpstop -u"
        And gpstop should return a return code of 0
        And the gpconfig context is setup
        And the user runs "gpconfig -c <guc> -v <seed_value>"
        And gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        # ensure <guc> is set to <seed_value> for the tests below
        And the user runs "gpstop -u"
        And gpstop should return a return code of 0

       # set same value on coordinator and segments
       When the user runs "gpconfig -c <guc> -v <value>"
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And verify that the last line of the file "postgresql.conf" in the coordinator data directory should contain the string "<guc>=<file_value>" escaped
        And verify that the last line of the file "postgresql.conf" in each segment data directory should contain the string "<guc>=<file_value>"

       # set value on coordinator only, leaving segments the same
       When the user runs "gpconfig -c <guc> -v <value_coordinator_only> --masteronly "
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And verify that the last line of the file "postgresql.conf" in the coordinator data directory should contain the string "<guc>=<file_value_coordinator_only>" escaped
        And verify that the last line of the file "postgresql.conf" in each segment data directory should contain the string "<guc>=<file_value>"

       # set value on coordinator with a different value from the segments
       When the user runs "gpconfig -c <guc> -v <value> -m <value_coordinator>"
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And verify that the last line of the file "postgresql.conf" in the coordinator data directory should contain the string "<guc>=<file_value_coordinator>" escaped
        And verify that the last line of the file "postgresql.conf" in each segment data directory should contain the string "<guc>=<file_value>"

       # now make sure the last changes took full effect as seen by gpconfig
       When the user runs "gpconfig -s <guc> --file"
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "Coordinator value: <file_value_coordinator>" escaped to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Segment     value: <file_value>" escaped to stdout

       When the user runs "gpconfig -s <guc> --file-compare"
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "GUCS ARE OUT OF SYNC" to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "value: <seed_value> | file: <file_value_coordinator>" escaped to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "value: <seed_value> | file: <file_value>" escaped to stdout

       When the user runs "gpstop -u"
       Then gpstop should return a return code of 0

       When the user runs "gpconfig -s <guc> --file-compare"
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "Coordinator value: <live_value_coordinator> | file: <file_value_coordinator>" escaped to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Segment     value: <live_value> | file: <file_value>" escaped to stdout

       When the user runs "gpconfig -s <guc>"
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "Coordinator value: <live_value_coordinator>" escaped to stdout
        And gpconfig should print "Segment     value: <live_value>" escaped to stdout

    Scenario: gpconfig check for GUC's with same prefix
      Given the user runs "gpstop -u"
        And gpstop should return a return code of 0
        And the gpconfig context is setup

        When the user runs "gpconfig -c gp_resqueue_priority -v 'off'"
        Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And verify that the file "postgresql.conf" in the coordinator data directory has "some" line starting with "gp_resqueue_priority"
        And verify that the file "postgresql.conf" in each segment data directory has "some" line starting with "gp_resqueue_priority"

        When the user runs "gpconfig -c gp_resqueue_priority_cpucores_per_segment -v '4'"
        Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And verify that the file "postgresql.conf" in the coordinator data directory has "some" line starting with "gp_resqueue_priority_cpucores_per_segment"
        And verify that the file "postgresql.conf" in each segment data directory has "some" line starting with "gp_resqueue_priority_cpucores_per_segment"

        When the user runs "gpconfig -c gp_resqueue_priority -v 'on'"
        Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And verify that the file "postgresql.conf" in the coordinator data directory has "some" line starting with "gp_resqueue_priority"
        And verify that the file "postgresql.conf" in each segment data directory has "some" line starting with "gp_resqueue_priority"

    Scenario: gpconfig checks liveness of correct number of hosts
      Given the database is running
       When the user runs "gpconfig --debug -c optimizer -v on"
       Then gpconfig should return a return code of 0
        And gpconfig should print "WorkerPool() initialized with 1 workers" escaped to stdout
